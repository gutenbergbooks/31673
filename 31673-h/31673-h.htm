<p>Although the account of the serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span>
engagement betwixt the <i>Cassandra</i> and the
two pirate vessels in the Mozambique Channel
hath already been set to print, the publick
have yet to know many lesser and more
detailed circumstances concerning the matter;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
and as the above-mentioned account
hath caused much remark and comment, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
shall take it upon me to give many incidents
not yet known, seeking to render
them neither in refined rhetorick nor with
romantick circumstances such as are sometimes
used by novel and story writers to
catch the popular attention, but telling this
history as directly, and with as little verbosity
and circumlocution, as possible.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A brief narration of the naval engagement between
Captain Mackra and the two pirate vessels
was given in the Captain's official report made at
Bombay. It appears in the life of the pirate England
in Johnson's book: "A Genuine Account of the Voyages
and Plunders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, &amp;c."
London, 1742.</p></div>

<p>For the conveniency of the reader, I shall
render this true and veracious account under
sundry headings, marked I., II., III., &amp;c.,
as seen above, which may assist him in separating
the less from the more notable portions
of the narrative.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>According to my log&mdash;a diary or journal
of circumstances appertaining to shipboard&mdash;it
was the nineteenth day of April, 1720,
when, I being in command of the East India
Company's ship <i>Cassandra</i>, billed for Bombay
and waiting for orders to sail, comes
Mr. Evans, the Company's agent, aboard with
certain sealed and important orders which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
he desired to deliver to me at the last minute.</p>

<p>After we had come to my cabin and were
set down, Mr. Evans hands me two pacquets,
one addressed to myself, the other superscribed
to one Benjamin Longways.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to inform me that the
Company had a matter of exceeding import
and delicacy which they had no mind to intrust
to any one but such, he was pleased to
say, as was a tried and worthy servant, and
that they had fixed upon me as the fitting
one to undertake the commission, which was
of such a nature as would involve the transfer
of many thousand pounds. He furthermore
informed me that a year or two before,
the Company had rendered certain aid to
the native King of Juanna, an island lying
between Madagascar and the east coast of
Africa, at a time when there was war betwixt
him and the king of an island called
Mohilla, which lyeth coadjacent to the other
country; that I should make Juanna upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
my voyage, and that I should there receive
through Mr. Longways, who was the Company's
agent at that place, a pacquet of the
greatest import, relating to the settlement
of certain matters betwixt the East India
Company and the king of that island. Concluding
his discourse, he further said that
he had no hesitation in telling me that the
pacquet which I would there receive from
Mr. Longways concerned certain payments
due the East India Company, and would, as
he had said before, involve the transfer of
many thousand pounds; from which I might
see what need there was of great caution
and circumspection in the transaction.</p>

<p>"But, sir," says I, "sure the Company is
making a prodigious mistake in confiding a
business of such vast importance as this to
one so young and so inexperienced as I."</p>

<p>To this Mr. Evans only laughed, and was
pleased to say that it was no concern of his,
but from what he had observed he thought
the honorable Company had made a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
choice, and that of a keen tool, in my case.
He furthermore said that in the pacquet
which he had given to me, and which was
addressed to me, I would find such detailed
instructions as would be necessary, and that
the other should be handed to Mr. Longways,
and was an order for the transfer
above spoken of.</p>

<p>Soon after this he left the ship, and was
rowed ashore, after many kind and complacent
wishes for a quick and prosperous voyage.</p>

<p>It may be as well to observe here as elsewhere
within this narrative that the Company's
written orders to me contained little
that Mr. Evans had not told me, saving only
certain details, and the further order that
that which the agent at Juanna should
transfer to me should be delivered to the
Governor at Bombay, and that I should receive
a written receipt from him for the
same. Neither at that time did I know the
nature of the trust that I was called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
to execute, save that it was of great import,
and that it involved money to some mightily
considerable amount.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Cassandra</i> consisted of
fifty-one souls all told, officers and ordinary
seamen. Besides these were six passengers,
the list of whom I give below, it having been
copied from my log-book journal:</p>

<p>Captain Edward Leach (of the East India
Company's service).</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Fellows (who was to take the
newly established agency of the Company
at Cuttapore).</p>

<p>Mr. John Williamson (a young cadet).</p>

<p>Mrs. Colonel Evans (a sister-in-law of the
Company's agent spoken of above).</p>

<p>Mistress Pamela Boon (a niece of the Governor
at Bombay).</p>

<p>Mistress Ann Hastings (the young lady's
waiting-woman).</p>

<p>Of Mistress Pamela Boon I feel extreme
delicacy in speaking, not caring to make publick
matters of such a nature as our subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
relations to one another. Yet this
much I may say without indelicacy, that she
was at that time a young lady of eighteen
years of age, and that her father, who had
been a clergyman, having died the year before,
she was at that time upon her way to
India to join her uncle, who, as said above,
was Governor at Bombay, and had been left
her guardian.</p>

<p>Nor will it be necessary to tire the reader
by any disquisition upon the other passengers,
excepting Captain Leach, whom I shall
have good cause to remember to the very
last day of my life.</p>

<p>He was a tall, handsome fellow, of about
eight-and-twenty years of age, of good natural
parts, and of an old and honorable family
of Hertfordshire. He was always exceedingly
kind and pleasant to me, and treated
me upon every occasion with the utmost
complacency, and yet I conceived a most
excessive dislike for his person from the
very first time that I beheld him, nor, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
events afterwards proved, were my instincts
astray, or did they mislead me in my sentiments,
as they are so apt to do upon similar
occasions.</p>

<p>After a voyage somewhat longer than
usual, and having stopped at St. Helena,
which hath of late been one of our stations,
we sighted the southern coast of Madagascar
about the middle of July, and on the
eighteenth dropped anchor in a little bay
on the eastern side of the island of Juanna,
not being able to enter into the harbor
which lyeth before the king's town because
of the shallowness of the water and the lack
of a safe anchorage, which is mightily necessary
along such a treacherous and dangerous
coast. In the same harbor we found
two other vessels&mdash;one the <i>Greenwich</i>, Captain
Kirby, an English ship; the other an
Ostender, a great, clumsy, tub-shaped craft.</p>

<p>I was much put about that I could get
no nearer to the king's town than I then
was, it being some seven or eight leagues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
away around the northern end of the island.
I was the more vexed that we could not
well come to it in boats, other than by a
long reach around the cape to the northward,
which would increase the journey to
wellnigh thirty miles. Besides all this, I
was further troubled upon learning from
Captain Kirby of the <i>Greenwich</i> that the
pirates had been very troublesome in these
waters for some time past. He said that
having been ashore soon after he had come
to that place, in search of a convenient spot
to take in water, he had found fourteen pirates
that had come in their canoes from
the Mayotta, where the pirate ship to which
they belonged, viz., the <i>Indian Queen</i>, two
hundred and fifty tons, twenty-eight guns,
and ninety men, commanded by Captain
Oliver de la Bouche, bound from the Guinea
coast to the East Indies, had been bulged
and lost.</p>

<p>I asked Captain Kirby what he had done
with the rogues. He told me, nothing at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
all, and that the less one had to do with
such fellows the better. At this I was vastly
surprised, and that he had taken no steps
to put an end to such a nest of vile, wicked,
and bloody-minded wretches when he had
it so clearly in his power to take fourteen
of them at once; more especially as he
should have known that if they got away
from that place and to any of their companions
they would bring the others not only
about his ears, but of every other craft that
might be lying in the harbor at the time.
Something to this effect I said, whereat he
flew into a mighty huff, and said that if I
had seen half the experience that he had
been through I would not be so free in my
threats of doing this or that to a set of
wretches no better than so many devils
from hell, who would cut a man's throat
without any scruples either of fear or remorse.</p>

<p>To all this I made no rejoinder, for the
pirates were far enough away by this time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
and I was willing to suppose that Captain
Kirby had done what he judged to be best
in the matter. Yet the getting away of
those evil wretches brought more trouble
upon me than had happened in all my life
before.</p>

<p>But, as was said before, I was in a pretty
tub of pickle with all those things; for I
could not bring my ship to anchor in any
reasonable distance of the king's town, nor
could I leave her and go on such a journey
as would take a day or more, lest the pirates
should come along in my absence. Neither
did I like to send any of the officers under
me to execute the commission, it being one
of such exceeding delicacy and secrecy. At
this juncture, and all of my passengers
knowing that we could not leave that place
till I had communicated certain papers to
the Company's agent at the king's town,
comes Captain Leach to me and volunteers
to deliver the pacquet addressed to Mr.
Longways. At first I was but little inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to accept of his complacency, but having a
secret feeling that I might be wronging
him by my prejudice against him, I determined
to give second thought to the matter
before I hastily declined his offer of aid.
Indeed, I may truthfully say I would have
felt more inclined to refuse his assistance if
I had entertained a more high opinion of
his person. As it was, I could see no reason
for not accepting his offer; he was regarded
everywhere as a man of rectitude
and of honor, and I had no real grounds to
impeach this opinion; so the end of the
business was that I accepted his aid with
the best face that I was able to command,
though that was with no very good grace,
and gave him leave to choose ten volunteers
as a boat's crew for the expedition.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>II.</h2>

<p>(The reader will be pleased to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
that, in pursuance of the plan above indicated,
I here begin a second part or chapter
of my narrative, the first dealing with
our voyage out as far as the island of Juanna,
and matters of a kindred nature, whilst
the following relates to an entirely different
subject, namely, the nature of the trust imposed
upon me, mention only of which has
heretofore been made.)</p>

<p>I do not now nor ever have believed that
Captain Leach had any other designs in offering
to execute my commission than that
of seizing so excellent an opportunity to see
a strange country and people after a long
and tiresome voyage upon the sea. Nevertheless,
my allowing him to go was one of
the greatest mistakes in all of my whole life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and cost me dearly enough before I had redeemed
it.</p>

<p>The expedition under him was gone for
three days, at the end of which time he returned,
in company with a great canoe manned
by a crew of about twenty tall, strapping
black fellows, and with two or three
sitting in the stern-sheets of the craft, bedecked
with feathers and beads, whom I
knew to be chiefs or warriors.</p>

<p>In the <i>Cassandra's</i> boat was a stranger
who sat beside Captain Leach, talking very
gayly, and who I knew could be none other
than Mr. Longways, the Company's agent.</p>

<p>So soon as the <i>Cassandra's</i> boat had come
alongside he skipped up the side like a monkey,
and gave me a very civil bow immediately
his feet touched the deck, which I returned
with all the gravity I was able to
command.</p>

<p>Mr. Longways was a lean, slim little man,
and was dressed with great care, and in the
very latest fashion that he could obtain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
from which, and his polite, affected manners
and grimaces, I perceived that he rarely had
the opportunity of coming upon board of a
craft where there were ladies as passengers.</p>

<p>After Mr. Longways came Captain Leach,
and after him the three great, tall, native
chiefs, half naked, and with hair dressed after
a most strange, curious fashion. At
first they would have prostrated themselves
at my feet, but I prevented them; whereupon
they took my hand and set it upon
their heads, which was anything but pleasant,
their hair being thick with gums and
greases.</p>

<p>I presently led the way to my cabin, the
chiefs following close at our heels, and Mr.
Longways walking beside me, grimacing
like a little old monkey in a vastly affected
manner. Nor could I forbear smiling to
see how he directed his observations towards
the ladies, and more especially Mistress
Pamela, who stood at the rail of the
deck above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mr. Longways carried in his hand a
strong iron despatch-box, about the bigness
of those used by the runners at the Bank,
and so soon as we had come into my cabin
he clapped it down upon the table with a
great noise.</p>

<p>"There!" says he, fetching a deep sigh;
"I, for one, am glad to be quit of it."</p>

<p>"Why," says I, "Mr. Longways, is there
then so much in the little compass of that
box?"</p>

<p>"Indeed yes," says he; "enough to make
you and me rich men for our lives."</p>

<p>"I wonder, then," says I, laughing, "that
you should bring it so easily to me, when
you might have made off with it yourself,
and no one the wiser."</p>

<p>"No, no," says he, quite seriously, without
taking my jest, and jerking his head
towards the black chiefs, who had squatted
down upon their hams nigh to the table&mdash;"No,
no. Our friends yonder have had
their eyes on me sharply enough, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
they do not understand one single word
that we are saying to one another."</p>

<p>While we had been conversing I had
fetched out a decanter of port and five
glasses, and had poured out wine for all
hands, which the black men drank with as
great pleasure as Mr. Longways and myself.</p>

<p>After Mr. Longways had finished, he
smacked his lips and set down his glass
with a great air. "And now," says he, with
a comical grimace of vanity and self-importance,
"let us to business without loss of
more time. First of all, I have to ask you,
sir, do you know what all this treasure is
for?"</p>

<p>I told him yes; that Mr. Evans had informed
me that it was as payment for certain
aid which the East India Company had
rendered to the king of that country.</p>

<p>"And how," says he, very slowly, and
cocking his head upon one side&mdash;"and how
do you think our King Coffee is to make
such payments? By bills upon the Bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of Africa? No, no. The treasure is all in
this box, every farthing of it; and I, sir, have
been chosen by the honorable East India
Company to have sole and entire charge of
it for more than two weeks past." Here
he looked at me very hard, as though he
thought I would have made some remark
upon what he had told me; but as I said
nothing he presently resumed his discourse,
after his own fashion. "I see," says he,
"that you do not appreciate the magnitude
of the trust that hath been imposed upon
me. I shall show you, sir." And without
more ado he fetched up a bunch of keys
out of his pocket. He looked at them
one after another until he found one somewhat
smaller than the rest, and with very
curiously wrought guards. "Look at this,"
says he; "there are only three in the world
like it. I hold one, King Coffee the other,
and the Governor of Bombay the third."
So saying, he thrust the key into the lock
of the despatch-box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
"Stop a bit, sir," said I, very seriously,
and laying my hand on his arm. "Have
you very well considered what you are doing?
Mr. Evans, the Company's agent, said
nothing to me concerning the nature of the
trust that was to be imposed upon me further
than it was of very great value; and
without you have received instructions to
tell me further concerning this business, I
much misdoubt that the Company intended
me to be further informed as to its nature."</p>

<p>"Why, look'ee, Captain Mackra," says he,
testily, "Tom Evans is one man and I am
another, and I tell you further that I am as
important an agent as he, even though he
does live in London and I in this outrageous
heathen country. Even if I had not intended
showing you this treasure before, I would
show it to you now, for I do not choose that
anybody should think that Tom Evans is a
man of more importance than I." So saying,
and without more ado, he gave a quick turn
to the key, and flung back the lid of the box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
I happened just then to glance at the
three chiefs, and saw that they were watching
us as a cat watches at a mouse-hole;
but so soon as they saw me observing them
they turned their eyes away so quickly that
I hardly felt sure that I had seen them.</p>

<p>Inside of the box was a great lot of dried
palm-leaf fibre wrapped around a ball of
cotton, which Mr. Longways lifted very carefully
and gently. Opening this, he came
upon a little roll of dressed skin like the
chamois-leather such as the jewellers and
watch-makers use, and which was tied all
about very carefully with a stout cord of
palm fibre. Mr. Longways began laboriously
to untie the knot in this cord, and,
though I cannot tell why, there was something
about the whole business that set my
heart to beating very thickly and heavily
within my breast.</p>

<p>Mr. Longways looked up under his brows
at me with a very curious leer. "Did you ever
hear," says he, "of The Rose of Paradise?"</p>

</div>

<p>I shook my head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I'll show her to you," said he; and
he began unwinding the cord from about
the roll of soft leather, the folds of which he
presently opened. Then, as I looked down
into his hand and saw what lay within the
dressed skin, I was so struck with amazement
that I could not find either breath or
tongue to utter one single word.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>III.</h2>

<p><i>It was a ruby, the most beautiful I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
ever seen, and about the bigness of a pigeon's
egg.</i></p>

<p>At the sight of this prodigious jewel I
was so disturbed in my spirits that I trembled
as though with an ague, while the
sweat started out of my forehead in great
drops. "For the love of the Lord, put it
up, man!" I cried, so soon as I could find
breath and wits.</p>

<p>There was something in my voice that
must have frightened Mr. Longways, for he
looked mightily disturbed and taken aback;
but he presently tried to pass it off for a
jest. "Come, come," says he, as he wrapped
up the stone in the soft leather again&mdash;"come,
come; it's all between friend and
friend, and no harm done."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
But to this I answered not a word, but
began walking up and down the cabin, so
affected by what I had seen that I could
neither recover my spirits nor regain my
composure. The more I thought over the
business the less I liked it; for if anything
should now happen to the stone, and it
should be lost, every suspicion would fall
upon me, since I was possessed of the
knowledge of the value of that which was
given into my charge. I could not but
marvel at the foolish and magpie vanity of
Mr. Longways that should thus lead him to
betray to an unknown stranger what even
I, though so ignorant of the value of such
gems, could easily perceive was a vast incalculable
treasure such as would make
any one man rich for a whole lifetime; and
even to this very day it is a matter of admiration
to me why the East India Company
should have put such a man in a
place of important trust, the only reason
that I can assign being that no better man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
could be found to take the agency in that
place.</p>

<p>"Look 'ee," said I, turning to him suddenly,
"have you told of this jewel, this Rose
of Paradise, to any one else?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" says he; and then he stopped,
and began gnawing his nether lip in a peevish
fashion.</p>

<p>"Come, come," says I, "speak out plain,
Master Longways, for this is no time for
dilly-dallying."</p>

<p>"Well," says he, blurting out his words,
"I did say something of it to Captain
Leach, who, I would have you know, is a
gentleman, and a man of honor into the
bargain."</p>

<p>"And tell me," said I, paying no attention
to his braggadocio air, "did you show
the stone to him also?"</p>

<p>He looked up and down, as though not
knowing what to say.</p>

<p>"Come, come, sir," said I, sternly, after
waiting for a moment or two and he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
answering me&mdash;"come, come, sir, I should
like to have an answer, if you please. You
will recollect that this trust now concerns
not only you, but also myself, and if anything
happens to the jewel I will be called
upon to answer for it as well as yourself;
so, as I said, you will answer my question."</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "Master Captain, and
what if I did? Do you mean to impeach
the honor of Captain Leach? I did show
it to him one day when we stopped along
the beach for water, if you must be told;
but I can promise you that not another soul
but yourself has seen it since I gave King
Coffee my written receipt for it."</p>

<p>I made no more comment, but began
again to walk up and down the cabin, vastly
disturbed in my mind by all that I heard.
Nothing could be gained by blaming the
poor fool, who all this time sat watching
me with a mightily troubled and disquieted
face. "Sir," said I, at last, turning to him&mdash;"sir,
I do not believe that you know what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
serious piece of folly you have committed
in this business. By rights I should have
nothing more to do with the matter, but
should leave you to settle it with the Company
as you choose; but my instructions
were to deliver the stone at Bombay, and I
will undertake to do my part to the best of
my power. I have nothing of blame to say
to you, but I must tell you plain that I cannot
have you longer about my ship; I do
not wish to order you to leave, but I will be
vastly obliged to you if you can return to
the king's town without longer stay."</p>

<p>At this address Mr. Longways grew very
red in the face. "Sir! sir!" he cried, "do
you dare to order me, an agent of the East
India Company, to leave one of that Company's
own ships?"</p>

<p>"That," said I, "you must salt to suit
your own taste."</p>

<p>"Very well!" cried he; "give me a receipt
for the stone and I'll go, though I tell
you plain that the Company shall hear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the fashion in which you have been pleased
to treat me."</p>

<p>I made no further answer to his words,
but sat down and wrote out the receipt,
specifying, however, the manner in which
The Rose of Paradise had been shown both
to Captain Leach and to myself.</p>

<p>For a while Mr. Longways hotly refused
to accept it in the form in which it was writ;
but finding that he could get no better, and
that he would either have to accept of it or
retain the stone in his own keeping until
some further opportunity offered for consigning
it to Bombay, he was finally fain to
take what he could get, whereupon he folded
up the paper and thrust it into his pocket,
and then left the cabin with a vast show of
dignity, and without so much as looking at
me or saying a word to me.</p>

<p>He and the chiefs got into the great canoe,
and rowed away whence they had come,
and I saw no more of him until above a
week afterwards, of which I shall have more
to say further on in my narration.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>IV.</h2>

<p>I did not go upon deck immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mr. Longways had left the cabin, but sat
there concerned with a great multitude of
thoughts, and gazing absently at the box
that held the treasure, and at the empty
glasses with the dregs of the wine in the
bottom.</p>

<p>Just in front of me was a small looking-glass
fastened against the port side of the
cabin in such position that by merely raising
my eyes I could see the cabin door from
where I sat.</p>

<p>In the upper part of the door was a little
window of two panes of glass, which opened
out under the overhang of the poop-deck.</p>

<p>Though I do not know what it was, something
led me to glance up from where I sat,
and in the glass I saw Captain Leach looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
in at that window with a mightily strange
expression on his face. He was not looking
at me, but at the iron despatch-box upon
the table, and I sat gazing at him for about
the space of eight or ten seconds, in which
time he moved neither his glance nor his
person. Suddenly he lifted his eyes and
looked directly into the glass, and his gaze
met mine. I had thought that he would
have been struck with confusion, and for a
moment it did seem as though his look faltered,
but he instantly recovered himself,
and tapped lightly upon the door, and I bade
him come in without moving where I sat.</p>

<p>He did as he was told, and sat down upon
the chair which Mr. Longways had occupied
only a few moments before. I confess that
I was both frightened and angry at finding
him thus, as it were, spying upon me, so
that it was a moment or two before I trusted
myself to speak.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I at last, "sure this voyage
hath been long enough for you to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the courtesies of shipboard require you to
send a message to the captain to find whether
he be disengaged or no."</p>

<p>Captain Leach showed no emotion at my
reproof. "Captain Mackra," said he, quietly,
"I do not know what that gabbling fool
of an agent has or has not said to you, but
I tell you plain he hath chosen to betray to
me certain important matters concerning
the East India Company, and that in yonder
despatch-box is a large ruby, valued at
nigh three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds sterling."</p>

<p>I may confess that I was vastly amazed
at the value of the stone, which was far greater
than I had conceived a notion of, but I
strove to show nothing of my sentiments to
my interlocutor.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" said I, looking him straight
in the face.</p>

<p>He seemed somewhat struck aback at
my manner, but he presently laughed lightly.
"You take the matter with most admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
coolness," said he; "far more than I
would do were I in your place. But at least
you will now perceive why I chose rather
to come to you of myself than to send a
messenger to you where a matter of such
delicacy was concerned."</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" said I.</p>

<p>Captain Leach looked for a moment or
two as though at a loss what next to say,
but he presently spoke again. "I came to
you," said he, "not knowing, as I said before,
whether or no Mr. Longways had betrayed
to you, as he has to me, the value of
the trust imposed upon you; and as I myself
am now unfortunately concerned in the
knowledge of this treasure, and so share in
your responsibility, I come hither to discover
what steps you propose taking to insure the
safety of the stone."</p>

<p>Now it hath come under my observation
that if a man be permitted to talk without
let or stay, he will sooner or later betray
that which lieth upon his mind. So from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the very moment that Captain Leach uttered
his last speech I conceived the darkest
and most sinister suspicions of his purposes;
nor from that time did I trust one
single word that he said, or repose confidence
in any of his actions, but was ready
to see in everything something to awaken
my doubts of his rectitude. Nor did these
sentiments arise entirely from his words, but
equally as much from my having discovered
him, as it were, so prying upon my privacy.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, rising from my seat, "I am
infinitely obliged to you for your kindness
in this affair, but as I have at present matters
of considerable import that demand
my closest attention, I must beg you to excuse
me."</p>

<p>Captain Leach looked at me for a moment
or two as though he had it upon his
mind to say something further. However,
he did not speak, but rising, delivered a very
profound bow, and left the cabin without
another word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
But there was no gainsaying the wisdom
of the advice which he had given me as to
concealing the treasure. Accordingly I obtained
from the carpenter a basket of tools,
and, bearing in mind the late visit with
which he had favored me, having shaded
the little window in the door of my cabin,
I stripped off my coat and waistcoat, and
after an hour or so of work, made shift to
rig up a very snug little closet with a hinged
door, in the bottom of my berth and below
the mattress, wherein I hid the jewel. After
that I breathed more freely, for I felt that
the treasure could not be discovered without
a long and careful search, the opportunities
for which were not likely to occur.</p>

<p>Although my interview with Captain
Leach might seem of small and inconsiderable
moment to any one coolly reading
this narrative in the privacy of his closet,
yet coming to me as it did upon the heels
of my other interview with Mr. Longways,
it cast me into such disquietude of spirit as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
I had not felt for a long time. I would have
heaved anchor and away, without losing one
single minute of delay, had it been possible
for me to have done so; but not a breath of
air was stirring, and there was nothing for
it but to ride at anchor where we were,
though, what with the heat and delay, it was
all that I could do not to chafe myself into
a fume of impatience.</p>

<p>So passed the day until about four o'clock
in the afternoon, when there happened a
certain thing that, had thunder and lightning
burst from a clear sky, it could not
have amazed me more. I being in my cabin
at the time, comes Mr. Langely, my first
mate, with the strange news that the lookout
had sighted a vessel over the point of
land to the southward. I could hardly accredit
what he said, for, as above stated, not
a breath of air was going. I hurried out of
my cabin and upon deck, where I found Mr.
White, the second mate, standing at the
port side of the ship, with a glass in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
hand directed a few points west of south,
and over a spit of land which ran out in
the channel towards that quarter, at which
place the cape was covered by a mightily
thick growth of scrub-bushes, with here and
there a tall palm-tree rising from the midst
of the thickets. Over beyond these I could
see the thin white masts of the vessel that
the lookout had sighted. There was no
need of the glass, for I could see her plain
enough, though not of what nature she
might be. However, I took the telescope
from Mr. White's hands, and made a long
and careful survey of the stranger, but as
much to hide my thoughts as for any satisfaction
that I could gain; for what confounded
me beyond measure was that a
vessel should be sighted so suddenly, and
in a dead calm, where I felt well assured no
craft had been for days past. Nor was I
less amazed to find, as I held the stranger
steadfastly in the circle of the object-glass,
a tall palm-tree being almost betwixt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<i>Cassandra</i> and her, and almost directly in
my line of sight, that she was slowly and
steadily making way towards the northward,
and at a very considerable angle with the
Gulf current, which there had a set more to
the westward than where we lay at anchor.</p>

<p>I think that all, or nearly all, of my passengers
were upon the poop-deck at that
time, Captain Leach with a pocket field-glass
which he had fetched with him from
England, and with which he was directing
Mistress Pamela's observation to the strange
craft. Nearly all the crew were also watching
her by this time, and in a little while
they perceived, what I had seen from the
first, that the vessel was by some contrivance
making head without a breath of wind,
and nearly against the Gulf current.</p>

<p>As for the stranger herself, so far as I
could judge, seeing nothing of her hull, she
was a bark of somewhat less tonnage than
the <i>Cassandra</i>; and the masts, which we
could perceive very clearly against the clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
sky, had a greater rake than any I had ever
before seen.</p>

<p>I do not know whether or not it was because
my mind was running so much upon
the pirates and upon the great treasure
which I had in my keeping, but I am free
to say that I liked the looks of the strange
craft as little as any I had ever beheld in
my life, and would have given a hundred
guineas to be safe away from where I was,
and with no more favor than a good open
sea and a smart breeze, for the <i>Cassandra</i>
was a first-rate sailer, and as good a ship as
any the East India Company had at their
docks.</p>

<p>As it was, we were cooped up in what
was little more than a pond, and I did not
like the looks of the business at all.</p>

<p>"What do you make her out to be, Mr.
Langely?" said I, after a bit, handing him
the glass.</p>

<p>He took a long and careful look at the
stranger without speaking for a while. By-and-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
he said, without taking his eye from
the glass, and as though speaking half
to himself, "She's making way against the
current somehow or other."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "I saw that from the first.
But what do you make of her?"</p>

<p>"I can make nothing of her," says he, after
a little while.</p>

<p>"Neither can I," I said; "and I like her
none the better for that."</p>

<p>Mr. Langely took his eye from the glass,
and gave me a very significant look, whereby
I saw that he had very much the same
notion concerning the stranger that I myself
entertained.</p>

<p>By this time there was considerable bustle
aboard the <i>Greenwich</i>, which rode at
anchor not more than a furlong or two from
where we lay, and by the gathering of the
men on the forecastle I could see that they
had sighted the craft, as we had already
done.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed until six o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
had come, against which time the stranger
had almost come into open sight beyond
the cape to the south, the hull alone being
hidden by the low spit of sand which formed
the extremity of the point.</p>

<p>That evening I took my supper along
with the passengers, as I had been used to
do, for I wished to appear unconcerned, as,
after all, my suspicions might be altogether
groundless. Nevertheless, I came upon
deck again as soon as I was able, and found
that the stranger was now so far come into
sight as to show a part of her hull, which
was low, and painted black, and was of such
an appearance as rather to increase than to
lessen my serious suspicions of her nature.</p>

<p>I could see there were two whale-boats
ahead of her, and it was very plain to me that
it was by means of these that the bark was
making head against the current. At first I
was more than ever amazed at this, seeing
that the current at that point could not run
at less than the rate of two or three knots an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
hour, against which two boats could not
hope to tow a craft of her size without some
contrivance to aid their efforts. Every now
and then I could hear the clicking of the
capstan, as though the vessel was heaving
anchor, and led by this sound, I after a while
perceived how she was making way, though
if I had not seen the same plan used in the
Strait of Malacca by the <i>City of Worcester</i>,
when I was there in the year '17, I much
misdoubt whether I could have so readily
discovered the design which they were in
this instance using. As it was, I was not
long in finding out what they were about.</p>

<p>The two boats ahead of the strange craft
were towing a square sail through the water
by a line fastened to the middle of the same.
From all four corners of this sail ran good
stout ropes, which were made fast to the
anchor cable of the bark. The two boats
might tow this square through the water
easily enough by that one line fastened to
the middle, because the sail would then close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and so slip easily through the water; but so
soon as the bark began to haul upon it from
all four corners it spread out as though filled
with wind, and so offered a vast resistance
to the water. By this contrivance the bark
was making headway at about the rate of a
knot an hour against the current, so that by
seven o'clock she was clear out beyond the
cape and into the open water beyond.</p>

<p>At that time the sun had not yet gone
down, and the distant vessel stood out
against the reddish-gray sky to the eastward,
with all the cordage and the masts as
sharp as so many hairs and straws in the
red light of the setting sun.</p>

<p>I was standing just under the poop-deck
at the time, with the glass to my eye, when,
of a sudden, I saw something black begin
rising from the deck to the fore. There
was not enough breeze going to spread it,
but I knew as well as anything in all of my
life that it was the "Black Roger," and that
the white that I could see among the folds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
was the wicked sign of the "skull and crossbones,"
which those bloody and cruel wretches
are pleased to adopt as the ensign of their
trade. Nor were we long in doubt as to
their design, for even as I watched I saw a
sudden puff of white smoke go up from her
side and hang motionlessly in the still air,
whilst a second or two later sounded the dull
and heavy boom of the distant cannon, and a
round shot came skipping across the water
from wave to wave, though too far away and
with too poor aim to do any damage from
that distance, which could not have been
less than two miles.</p>

<p>"What does that mean, captain?" said
Mistress Pamela, who stood with the other
passengers observing the bark from the
poop-deck above.</p>

<p>"A salute, madam," said I, and so shut
my glass and went into my cabin, where Mr.
Langely presently joined me at my request,
and where we talked over this very ugly
piece of business at our leisure.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>V.</h2>

<p>In those hot latitudes, such as Madagascar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the darkness cometh very sudden after
sunset, and with no long twilights such as
we have in England, so that within half an
hour after the pirate had saluted us with a
round shot, as told above, it had passed from
daylight to night-time, and there being no
moon until about four o'clock in the morning,
it was very dark, with an infinite quantity
of stars shining most beautifully in the
sky.</p>

<p>I ordered my gig to be made ready, and
went aboard the <i>Greenwich</i>, where I found
Captain Kirby suffering under the utmost
consternation of spirits. He took me straight
to his cabin, where, when we were set down,
he fell to blaming himself most severely for
not having clapped chains upon the fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
pirates whom he had found on the island
upon his arrival at that place, and who, it
was very plain to see, had given such information
to their fellows as had brought a
great number of them down upon us.</p>

<p>So soon as I was able I checked him in
his self-reproaches. "Come, come, Captain
Kirby," says I, "'tis no time for vain regrets,
but rather to be thinking to protect ourselves
and those things that we have in trust
from these bloody wretches, who would strip
us of all."</p>

<p>So, after a while, he quieted in some measure,
and the captain of the Ostender coming
aboard about this time, we made shift
betwixt us to settle some sort of a plan for
mutual protection.</p>

<p>According to my suggestions it was determined
to get out warps upon the port
side of all three crafts, which now lay heading
towards the south, because of the set of
the current. By means of these warps the
vessels might be brought to lie athwart the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
channel, which was so narrow at this place
that, should the pirate craft venture into the
harbor, she would be raked by all three in
turn. These matters being settled, I returned
to the <i>Cassandra</i> again.</p>

<p>That night I had but little sleep, but was
in and out of my cabin continually. Whenever
I was upon the deck I could hear the
"click, click, click" of the capstan aboard
the pirate vessel, sounding more clearly
through the dampness of the night than in
the daytime. There was still not a breath
of air going, and I thought it likely that the
pirate intended making her way into the
harbor that night, but about three o'clock
in the morning the noise of working the
capstan ceased, and I fancied that I heard
a sound as of dropping anchor, though I
could make out nothing through the darkness,
even with the night-glass.</p>

<p>Nor was I mistaken in my surmise that
the pirate craft had come to anchor, for
when the day broke I perceived that she lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
between two and three miles away, just outside
of the capes, and directly athwart the
channel, being stayed by warps, broadside
on, as we ourselves were in the harbor, so
as to rake any vessel that should endeavor
to come out, as we might rake any that
would endeavor to come in.</p>

<p>As this day also was very quiet, with not
a breath of wind stirring, I expected that
the pirate would open fire, though at such
a long range. However, this she did not
do, but lay there as though watching us,
and as though to hold us where we were
until some opportunity or other had ripened.
And so came the night again, with
nothing more of note having happened than
the day before.</p>

<p>Ever since we had lain at this spot native
canoes (called by the sailors bumboats) had
come from the shore from day to day, laden
with fruit and fresh provisions, which are
most delicious, refreshing luxuries after a
prolonged sea-voyage, such as ours had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
been. That day they had come as usual,
though there was little humor for bartering
with them upon such a serious occasion.</p>

<p>However, I had observed, and not without
surprise, that Captain Leach, though he
knew the nature of the pirate craft, and the
serious situation in our affairs, appeared so
little affected by the danger which threatened
us that he bought a lot of fresh fruit,
as usual, and held a great deal of conversation
with one of the natives, who spoke a
sort of English which he had picked up
from our traders.</p>

<p>I had not thought much of this at the
time, although, as I had observed before, it
was not without surprise that I beheld what
he did; beyond this I reckoned nothing of
it, nor would have done so had not matters
of the utmost importance afterwards recalled
it to my attention.</p>

<p>That night I had no more appetite for
sleep than the night before, and finding little
rest or ease in my cabin, was up upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
deck for most of the time. Though I did
not choose just then to hold conversation
with my passengers, I noticed that they
were all upon deck, where they sat talking
together in low tones. As the night advanced,
however, they betook themselves to
their cabins, one after another, until only
Captain Leach was left sitting alone.</p>

<p>He remained there for maybe the space
of half an hour, without moving a hair's-breadth,
so far as I could see. At the end
of about that length of time, being in a
mightily anxious state, I stepped forward to
see for myself that the watch was keeping a
sharp lookout. I was not gone for more
than a minute or two, but when I came back
I saw that Captain Leach was no longer
where he had been before; yet although I
noticed this circumstance at the time, I gave
no more thought to it than I would upon
an ordinary occasion.</p>

<p>As there was no one on the poop, I myself
went up upon that deck, it being so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
much cooler there than on the quarter-deck
below. I took out my pipe and filled it,
thinking to have a quiet smoke, which is
a most efficacious manner of soothing any
perturbation or fermentation of spirits. Just
as I was about to strike my flint for a light,
I heard a noise under the stern-sheets, as of
some one stepping into a boat, and almost
immediately afterwards a slight splash, as
of an oar or a paddle dipped into the water.
I ran hastily to the side of the vessel, and
looked astern and into the water below.</p>

<p>Although the sky was clear, the night
was excessively dark, as one may often see
it in those tropical latitudes; yet I was as
well assured that a boat of some sort had
left the ship as if I had seen it in broad daylight,
because of the phosphorescent trail
which it left behind it in its wake.</p>

<p>I had slipped a pistol into my belt before
quitting my cabin, and as I hailed the boat
I drew it and cocked it, for I thought that
the whole occurrence was of a mightily suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
nature. As I more than half expected,
I got no answer. "Boat, ahoy!" I
cried out a second time, and then, almost
immediately, levelled my pistol and fired,
for I saw that whoever the stranger was,
he had no mind to give me an answer.</p>

<p>At the report of the pistol both Mr.
Langely and Mr. White came running to
where I was, and I explained the suspicious
circumstances to them, whereupon
Mr. Langely suggested that it might have
been a shark that I had seen, vast quantities
of which voracious animals dwell in
those and the neighboring waters. I did
not controvert what he said, although I
knew beyond a doubt that it was a craft of
some sort which I had discovered&mdash;possibly
a canoe, for the dip of the paddle, which I
had distinctly seen in the phosphorescence
of the water, appeared first upon the one
side of the wake and then upon the other,
as the blade was dipped into the water from
side to side; so although, as I said, I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
undertake to controvert Mr. Langely's opinion,
I was mightily discomposed in my own
mind concerning the business.</p>

<p>At this time there was a vast deal of disturbance
aboard the <i>Greenwich</i> and the Ostender
because of my hail and the discharge
of the pistol, which, however, soon quieted
down when they found that nothing further
followed upon the alarm.</p>

<p>I walked up and down the poop-deck for
a great while, endeavoring to conceive what
could be the meaning of the boat, which
had most undoubtedly been lying under the
stern of the <i>Cassandra</i>, and how it came
that the watch had failed so entirely to discover
its arrival. It would not have been
possible for an ordinary ship's boat to come
upon us so undiscovered, for, as I myself
knew, the watch were keeping a sharper
lookout than usual; therefore this circumstance,
together with that which I had above
observed concerning my opinion that the
craft had been rowed with a paddle, led me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
to conclude that it was one of the native
canoes, though I was as far as ever from
guessing what the object of the visit had
been, or what it portended. As I sat ruminating
upon this subject, looking straight
ahead of me, without thinking whither my
observation was directed, I presently perceived
that I was looking absently at the
spot where Captain Leach had been sitting
a little while before. This led me to think
of him, and from him of the jewel that was
in my keeping, and of its excessive value.
Of a sudden it flashed into my mind, as
quick as lightning, what if Captain Leach
should have it in his mind to practice some
treachery upon us all?</p>

<p>I may truly say that this thought would
never have entered my brains had not the
circumstance of Captain Leach's conversation
with me in my cabin tended to set it
there. But no sooner had this gloomy suspicion
found place in my mind than it and
those troubles which had beset me of late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and the loss of that sleep which I had failed
to enjoy the night before, together cast me
into such a ferment of spirits as I hope I
may never again experience. Nor could I
reason my mind out of what I could not
but feel might be insane and unreasonable
fancyings.</p>

<p>At last I could bear my uncertainties no
longer, but went down into the great cabin,
and so to the door of the berth which Captain
Leach occupied. I knocked softly upon
the door, and then waited a while, but received
no answer. After that I knocked
again, and louder, but with no better success
than before. Finding I was like to
have no answer to my knocking, I tried the
door, and found that it was locked.</p>

<p>My heart began to beat at a great rate at
all this; but I suddenly bethought me that
perhaps the captain was a sound sleeper
and not easily roused. If this were so, and
he were in his cabin, and had locked the
door upon himself, I could easily convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
myself of the fact, for it hardly could be
doubted but that the key would be in the
key-hole. I drew out my pocket-knife,
opened a small blade which it contained,
and thrust it into the key-hole. There was
no key there!</p>

<p>This discovery acted upon my spirits in
such a manner that a douse of water could
not have cooled me quicker; for now that
my worst suspicions were so far confirmed&mdash;for
I felt well assured that Captain Leach
was nowhere aboard the ship&mdash;my perturbation
left me, and I grew of a sudden as
calm as I am at this very moment. However,
to make matters more assured, I rapped
again upon the door of the cabin, and this
time with more vigor than before; but although
I repeated the knocking four or five
times, I received no answer, and so went upon
deck to consider the matter at my leisure.</p>

<p>My first thought was of the jewel in my
keeping, and that Captain Leach had made
off with it. My cooler reason told me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
this could not be, I having taken such effectual
means to hide it, as before stated.
Nevertheless, I went to my cabin and examined
my hiding-place to set my mind
at rest, finding, as might be expected, that
the jewel was safely there.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to tell Mr. Langely
of my suspicions, but in digesting the matter
it appeared to me best to keep them to
myself for the present; for if I should, after
all, prove wrong in my surmise, it would
only add to the entanglement to have another
involved in the business before anything
certain had been discovered; moreover,
should I observe sufficient cause for
using extreme measures against Captain
Leach, I might easily arrest him at any
time, having him entirely in my power.</p>

<p>Having settled this matter to my own
satisfaction, I determined to lie in wait for
his return, and to discover how he himself
would explain his absence.</p>

<p>I surmised that he must have left the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
from the boat which was hanging to the
davits astern, and on inspecting the matter,
found that I was correct, and that a stout
line, such as might easily bear the weight of a
man, had been lashed to one of the falls, and
hung to within a foot or two of the water.
I was then well assured that Captain Leach
must have clambered into the boat astern
whilst I had gone forward, as told above,
and had dropped thence into the canoe by
means of the line just spoken of. The noise
which I had heard I conceived to have been
caused by his making a misstep, or by the
canoe rising with the ground-swell more
than he had expected.</p>

<p>Now, if he left the ship in that manner,
of which, according to my mind, there could
be but little doubt, there was equal certainty
that he would return by the same way;
so I determined to lie in watch for him
there, and to tax him with his absence so
soon as he should come aboard. Accordingly
I laid myself down in the boat astern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
as comfortably as I could contrive, and
lighting my pipe, watched with all the patience
I could command for the return of
the fugitive.</p>

<p>I judge that I lay there for the space
of two or three hours, and in all that
time saw or heard nothing to arouse my
suspicions; nor do I believe that I would
have discovered anything had I not been
watching at that very place, for so quiet
was Captain Leach's return that I heard
no sound of oars nor knew anything of it
until I saw the line that hung at the davits
moved from below by some one climbing
aboard. I lay perfectly still and made no
noise until he had clambered into the boat
and stood within a few feet of me.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," says I, as quietly as I could
speak, "and may I ask where you have been
for all this long time?"</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>VI.</h2>

<p>Had a pistol been fired beside his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
he could not have started more violently,
and I had thought that he would have been
utterly dumfounded; but he recovered himself
with a most amazing quickness.</p>

<p>"Why, Captain Mackra," says he, with a
laugh, "and is it you that welcome me back
again, like the prodigal that I am?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, very sternly, "you will be
pleased to answer my question, for I tell
you plain that I am in no humor for jesting
upon this occasion."</p>

<p>"And why should I not jest?" says he;
"the whole business is a jest from first to
last. As all this coil has been made about
a very simple piece of business, I am forced
to tell what I had not intended to tell, and
which I am surprised that a man of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
feeling should urge another into declaring.
A man of parts, sir, may find favor with
dusky beauties as well as with white; nor
can I see what more harm there may be in
visiting a sweetheart here than at Gravesend,
which I doubt not you yourself have
done, and that more than once."</p>

<p>I confess that I was vastly struck aback
at this reasonable answer, and began for a
moment to misdoubt that my suspicions of
the captain were correct. For a while I
stood, not knowing what to say, when of a
sudden certain circumstances struck me that
Captain Leach's words had not explained.</p>

<p>"And why," said I, "at a time of such
anxiety and uncertainty, did you not ask
permission to leave the ship?"</p>

<p>"I should think," says he, "a man of delicacy
would have no need to ask such a question
as that."</p>

<p>"Then tell me this," I cried, "<i>why did you
not direct your course towards the land instead
of towards the open sea?</i></p>

<p>"Why," says he, laughing, and answering"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with the utmost readiness, "I thought of
nothing at all but of getting away from the
ship as fast as possible, seeing that some
hasty fool aboard was blazing away at me
with a pistol or musquetoon, and that if I
had been picking my course at the time I
might have wound up the business with an
ounce of lead in my brains, instead of enjoying
this pleasant conversation in such
good health."</p>

<p>All this time we had been standing within
a foot or two of one another, I looking
him straight in the face, though I could see
nothing of it in the darkness. For a moment
or two I could make no answer, his
words being so mightily plausible; and yet
I did not believe a single one of them, for
they ran so smoothly and glibly that I could
not but feel convinced that he had them
already sorted and arranged for just such
an occasion as the present.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, in a low voice, for I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
afraid lest my indignation should get the
better of me, "I tell you plain that, though
your words are so smooth, I do not believe
that which you tell me. Go to your cabin,
sir, and let me tell you that if I see anything
that may tend to confirm my suspicions
of you, I will clap you in irons, without
waiting a second, and as sure as you
are a living man."</p>

<p>"Captain Mackra," said he, in a voice as
quiet as that I myself had used, "if ever I
come safely to land, you shall answer to me
for these words, sir."</p>

<p>"That as you please," said I; and thereupon
turned and left the boat, entering my
own cabin so soon as I had seen that Captain
Leach had obeyed my orders by betaking
himself to his.</p>

<p>I was not thus quickly to see the last of
this part of the affair, for early the next
morning, and before I had left my cabin,
Mr. Langely comes to me with a message
from Captain Leach to the effect that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
would like to have a few words with me. I
at once sent a return message that I would
be pleased to see him at whatever time it
might suit him to come. Accordingly in
about five minutes he knocked upon the
door of my cabin, and I bade him enter. I
motioned him to a chair, but he only bowed
and remained standing where he was, nigh
to the door.</p>

<p>"Captain Mackra," said he, coldly, "you
were pleased to put upon me last night a
gross and uncalled-for insult. I cannot summon
you to account for it at present, although
I hope to do so in the future. But
you may perceive, sir, that it will be best
both for you and for myself that I should
withdraw from this ship, and finish my passage
to India, as the opportunity now offers,
either in the <i>Greenwich</i> or the <i>Van Weiland</i>"
(which was the name of the Ostend
boat).</p>

</div>

<p>I was overjoyed at so propitious an opportunity
of getting thus easily rid of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
uncomfortable passenger. However, I think
I showed nothing of this to him&mdash;at least I
endeavored not to do so&mdash;and told him that
a boat was at his service if he chose to look
for another berth for the rest of the voyage.
I myself went upon deck and had the gig
lowered, into which Captain Leach presently
stepped, having bid good-by to his fellow-passengers,
and having said that he would
send for his chest so soon as he had secured
a berth in one or the other of the vessels
mentioned. I gave directions to the boatswain,
who was captain of the gig, to await
Captain Leach's orders until he should indicate
that he had no further use for the
boat, and then saw him rowed away to the
<i>Greenwich</i> with the most inexpressible pleasure.</p>

<p>The <i>Cassandra's</i> boat lay alongside of the
<i>Greenwich</i> for maybe half an hour, at the
end of which time I was surprised to see
Captain Leach re-enter her, and direct his
course to the Ostender, which lay a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
distance beyond. He remained aboard of
her for about the same length of time that
he had stayed with the <i>Greenwich</i>, after
which he climbed the boat for a third time,
and directed his course for the <i>Cassandra</i>
again.</p>

<p>I was standing upon the quarter-deck
when he came aboard, and he approached
me with a countenance expressive of the utmost
mortification and chagrin.</p>

<p>"Captain Mackra," said he, "I find that
by a most unfortunate sequence of events I
can find a berth neither aboard the <i>Greenwich</i>
nor the Ostender, so that nothing remains
but for me to force my unwelcome
presence upon you for the balance of the
voyage."</p>

<p>I own that I was very much disappointed
by these words. However, nothing remained
but to put the best face possible
upon the matter. "Sir," said I, as graciously
as I could contrive to speak, although I
am afraid that my tone was expressive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
my disappointment, "it was at your own
suggestion that you quitted the <i>Cassandra</i>;
your berth, sir, is still ready for your occupation."</p>

<p>He said nothing further, but indicating
his acknowledgments with a bow, proceeded
directly to his cabin.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>VII.</h2>

<p>As I was in such a ferment of spirit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
all this time, and so fearful of an attack
from the pirate craft, having continually in
my mind not only the treasure, but also the
helpless women intrusted to my keeping, it
might occur to the reader to ask why I did
not send both it and them to such a place
of safety upon the land as the king's town
offered to English people beset as we were.
I may now say that I had considered it, and
had perceived that more than one difficulty
lay in the way. In the first place, I could
not send the ship's boat to the king's town,
because that in passing the cape to the
northward they would come within a mile
or less of the pirate craft, from which they
might not hope to escape without molestation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Secondly, I could not send them across
the country, because it would require not
only an escort such as could be ill spared
at this juncture, but also an efficient leader,
who might be spared even less readily. Besides
this, I could not tell what dangers such
a party might encounter, not only from natives,
of whose disposition I knew nothing,
but also from wild beasts, which we could
hear distinctly every night, howling in the
jungles in a most melancholy, dreadful manner.</p>

<p>Thirdly and lastly, I did not believe the
pirates would stay long where they were,
as I had often heard of the cowardly disposition
of these bloody wretches; wherefore
I hoped that, seeing how well we were
posted to guard ourselves against an attack
from them, they might take themselves
away upon the first occasion, which they
could not now do because of the calm
weather. I furthermore argued that in any
event, should occasion render it necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
I could easily disembark my passengers
with but little loss of time, and as easily and
safely then as now.</p>

<p>Such had been the nature of my thoughts
whenever I had directed them upon the
melancholy and gloomy state of our affairs.
Yet had the most sinister forebodings which
I had entertained at those times been fulfilled,
our misfortunes could not have equalled
those which in truth fell upon us, the
history of which I have immediately to tell.</p>

<p>Captain Leach's trip in search of a new
berth had been undertaken so early in the
morning that it was not yet noon when
he had returned. Some little time after
that, I being in my own cabin at the time,
there came of a sudden a sound that was,
as it were, the first muttering of the storm
that was so soon to fall upon us. It was
the dull and heavy boom of a single cannon,
sounding from a great way off, and which I
instantly knew had been fired aboard of the
pirate craft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
I went straight upon the deck, where I
found the weather still as dead a calm as it
had been the two days before, with not so
much as a breath of air stirring or a cat's-paw
upon the water. The ground-swell rose
and fell as smoothly as though the sea ran
with oil instead of water, and the sky above
had an appearance as of a solid sheet of
steel-blue, with not so much as one single
cloud upon the whole face of it. But the
first thing that I beheld was the pirate craft,
and that they were hoisting sail as though
they perceived a breeze coming, of which
we saw nothing. Across her port bow the
smoke of her gun still hung like a round
white cloud just above the glassy surface of
the sea.</p>

<p>"Sure she means to quit us, Mr. Langely,"
said I; but Mr. Langely never answered,
for just as he opened his lips to speak, the
lookout roared, "Sail ho!"</p>

<p>"Where away?" sang out Mr. White, who
was officer of the deck at that time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
But before the word reached us I myself,
and I suspect most of the others, had sighted
the craft away to the southward, coming up
under full sail, and with a breeze of which
we could see nothing.</p>

<p>She was at that time some six or seven
miles distant, and just emerging from behind
a raised thicket of scrub bushes that
lay betwixt her and the <i>Cassandra</i>, and
which had hidden her until now.</p>

<p>The strange craft was a large sloop, of
such an appearance that even had not the
pirate fired that which was no doubt a signal-gun,
methinks I should have entertained
the most sinister and gloomy forebodings
concerning her nature and her character.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her, Mr. Langely?"
said I, after watching her for some time in
silence.</p>

<p>"It is the pirate's consort, sir," said he,
very seriously.</p>

<p>"I do believe you are right," said I, "and
that is why she has been waiting for all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
days, keeping us bottled up so that we could
not have got away even if we had had a
breeze."</p>

<p>I did not tell Mr. Langely all that was
upon my mind; nevertheless, I could not
but regard our present position as one of
the most extreme peril. For if one pirate
craft, with its crew of blood-thirsty wretches,
was a match for us sufficient to hold us
where we now were, what harm might not
two of them accomplish should they attack
us peaceful merchantmen, unused as we
were to the arts of war, in this narrow harbor,
where we might hope neither to man&oelig;uvre
nor to escape.</p>

<p>We were already cleared for action, having
had full time to prepare ourselves since
danger had first threatened us; accordingly,
leaving Mr. Langely to supervise such
few details as might still remain to demand
attention, I had my gig lowered, and went
aboard of the <i>Greenwich</i> to consult with
Captain Kirby as to means of defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
ourselves against this new and additional
danger that threatened our existence.</p>

<p>The Ostend captain was there when I
came aboard, and I fancied, though I then
knew not why, that he and Captain Kirby
looked at one another in a very strange and
peculiar manner when I entered the cabin.
Besides that, I noticed little or no preparation
for action had been made.</p>

<p>"We'll stand by you," says Captain Kirby;
"in course we'll stand by you, though
you must know it is each one for himself,
and devil take the hindmost, at such times
as these."</p>

<p>I was mightily amazed and taken aback
at this speech. "And why do you talk so
about standing by me, Captain Kirby?" said
I. "Is it not, then, that we stand by one
another? Is my craft in greater peril than
yours, or am I to be given up as a sacrifice
to these wicked and bloody wretches?"</p>

<p>I thought he seemed vastly disturbed at
this speech.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
"In course," says he, "we'll stand by one
another. All the same, each must look out
for himself."</p>

<p>I regarded Captain Kirby for a while
without speaking, and he seemed more than
ever troubled at my gaze.</p>

<p>"Sir! sir!" I cried, "I must tell you that
I do not understand this matter. Do you
not mean to make a fight of it?"</p>

<p>At this he flew into a mighty fume.
"How!" says he; "do you mean to question
my courage? Do you call me a coward?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," says I, "I call you nothing;
only I did not understand your speech.
Sure, sir, you cannot but remember that I
have three helpless women aboard my ship,
and that it behooves you as a man and an
Englishman to stand by me in this time of
peril."</p>

<p>So saying, I left the cabin and the ship,
but with the weight of trouble that lay
upon my mind anything but lightened, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
I could not understand why, we all being
in this peril together, neither he nor the
Ostend captain had spoken a single word
concerning our defence.</p>

<p>However, I yet retained the hope that
the pirates would not venture into our harbor,
seeing that we were three to two, and
lying in a chosen position whence we might
hope to defend ourselves for a long time,
and to their undoing.</p>

<p>Upon my return I found my passengers
all in the great cabin, and in a very
serious mood, having heard some rumor
as to the danger that threatened. I stood
for a while as though not knowing what
to say, but at last I made shift to tell
them how matters stood, and in what danger
we were like to be, though I smoothed
everything over as much as lay in my
power. I think that our peril had been
pretty well discussed amongst them before
I confirmed it with that which I said.
Nevertheless, I am amazed even now at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the coolness with which all hands regarded
it.</p>

<p>Mistress Pamela, I recollect, laid her
hand lightly upon my arm. "Whatever
our danger may be," she cried, "this we all
know, that we could confide our safety to
no truer sailor nor more gallant man than
he who commands this ship." This she said
before them all who were there standing.</p>

<p>In my cabin I summoned Mr. Langely
and Mr. White (my second mate) to a serious
consultation, which was the last we
were to hold before that great and bloody
battle concerning which so much hath been
writ and spoken of late. When we had
finished our councils we came upon deck
again, and found that the sloop was rather
less than a mile distant from the other craft,
and in a little while she hove to nigh to the
barque, and let go her anchor with a splash
and rattle of the cable which we could hear
distinctly whence we lay.</p>

<p>For half an hour Mr. Langely and I stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
upon the poop-deck watching the two crafts
by aid of the telescope, and what we saw in
that time foreboded to my mind no good
to ourselves.</p>

<p>First we beheld a boat pass from the
barque to the sloop, and in which was one
evidently of great consequence amongst the
pirates, for by aid of the glass we could
distinguish that his apparel was better than
the others, and also that he wore what appeared
to be a crimson scarf tied about his
body.</p>

<p>He remained aboard the sloop for maybe
the space of ten minutes, at the end of
which time he returned again to the barque,
where they immediately began lowering
away the boats. Four of these boats were
filled with men who were all transported to
the sloop, up the side of which we soon saw
them swarm to the number of fifty or more.</p>

<p>Whilst these things had been going forward,
Mr. Langely and I had been standing
in silence, but now my first mate turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
me, "Sir," said he, "methinks that they mean
to attack us."</p>

<p>I nodded my head in answer, but said
nothing.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>By this time the breeze was wellnigh
upon us, for the smooth water all around
us was dusked by the little cat's-paws that
swept the glassy surface.</p>

<p>Now that morning, just before the pirate
sloop hove in sight, I had got out warps by
means of which I hoped to change our position,
bringing the <i>Cassandra</i> nigher to the
<i>Greenwich</i>, and to a station of greater defence.
In this, however, we had made but
little progress, for the current set strong
against us at the present state of the tide.
Seeing now the imminence of the attack,
I hoisted sail, hoping to take advantage of
the first wind, and bring the <i>Cassandra</i>
closer to the <i>Greenwich</i>.</p>

<p>What followed I am even now not able
to explain, for I am slow to believe that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
English captain could desert another in
such an emergency as the present. It might
be that Captain Kirby thought that we intended
trying to get away upon the wind,
for the <i>Greenwich</i> also began immediately
to set all her sail. Seeing what they were
about I hailed the other craft, but got no
answer. Then I hailed her again and again,
but still received no reply.</p>

<p>The next minute she, being open to the
first puffs of the breeze by a valley, filled
and bore away, followed by the Ostender,
who had also set her sails, leaving me becalmed
where I was.</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Mr. Langely, "do they
mean to desert us? Look, sir, here come
the pirates!"</p>

<p>I had just then been so intent upon the
other vessels that I had not thought of observing
what our enemies were about, not
thinking that they would take such immediate
action. But, no doubt, seeing us set
our sails, and fearing that we might get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
away, slipped their own cables; for they
were now coming down upon us with the
freshening wind, having already entered the
channel as boldly as though there were
none to oppose them, the sloop leading the
others by a quarter of a mile or so. Indeed
the <i>Greenwich</i> and the Ostender bearing
away had left the passage entirely open to
them, with no one but ourselves to oppose
them.</p>

<p>In this extremity I hailed the <i>Greenwich</i>
for a third time, and getting no answer, ordered
the gunner to fire across her bows,
but in spite of this she did not heave to,
whereupon we gave her a round shot, but
whether to her harm or no I am not able
to say.</p>

<p>And now nothing remained for us but
to fight what appeared a hopeless battle
against heavy odds.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The main ship-channel leading from the
offing to the bay or harbor wherein the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
<i>Cassandra</i>, the <i>Greenwich</i>, and the Ostender
had been riding for these days past,
lead almost easterly and westerly, but so
shaped by the sand-bars to the south and
those shoals that ran out from the northern
cape as to take the form of a very crooked
letter S. Nowhere was this channel over
half or three-quarters of a mile wide, and in
some places it was hardly more than a quarter
of a mile wide.</p>

<p>From the position which the <i>Cassandra</i>
occupied this entrance to the harbor was
so well defended that any vessel entering
thereat must be twice raked by our broadside
fire, once in rounding the northern,
and once the southern angle of the channel.
Hence it was that I determined to hold our
present position as long as I was able.</p>

<p>But the pirates did not both attack us by
way of the main ship-channel as we had
expected, for when they had rounded the
northern angle the sloop, fearing perhaps
that we would try to get away upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
wind, instead of keeping in consort with
the barque, made directly for us across the
shoals that lay between us and them. This
they were able to do without running
aground, both because of their intimate
knowledge of these intricate waters and of
the small amount of water which the sloop
drew.</p>

<p>"We'll rake 'em anyhow," says I to Mr.
Langely, for I could see no other means for
them to approach us but to come upon us
bow on, there being no room to man&oelig;uvre
among the bars and shoals that lay betwixt
us and them.</p>

<p>But the devilish ingenuity of these
cruel, wicked wretches supplied them with
other means than a direct attack upon
the <i>Cassandra</i>, for, when they had come
within about a mile or so of us, they
hove to, dropped their main-sail, and, running
out great oars from the ports between
decks, began rowing towards us in
a clumsy fashion, somewhat after the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
of a galleon. By this means, and by
the aid of the current which set towards
us, they were enabled to keep nearly broadside
on, and so avoid being raked by our
fire.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langely," said I, "if they are able
to board us we are lost. Order the gunner
to fire upon the oars and not upon the
decks."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," says he, and turned away.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>VIII.</h2>

<p>The pirates were the first to open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
battle, which they did when within about a
quarter of a mile from us, giving us a broadside.
It was the first time that I had ever
been under fire in all of my life, and never
shall I forget it as long as I may live. Their
aim was wonderfully accurate, so that when
their shot struck us a great cloud of white
splinters flew from a dozen places at once.
I saw three men drop upon the deck, and
one who stood at a gun on the quarter-deck
just below me leaned suddenly forward half
across the cannon with a deep groan, whilst
a fountain of blood gushed out from his
bosom across the carriage and upon the deck.
One of the others caught him by the arm,
whereupon he turned half round and then
slipped and fell forward upon his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
He was the first man killed in this action,
and the first that I ever beheld die in a like
manner.</p>

<p>The <i>Cassandra</i> answered the pirate's fire
almost immediately. But our guns were
trained, as I had ordered, upon the oars
and not upon the crowded decks, so that
while every shot that they delivered told
upon the lives of the poor fellows aboard
the <i>Cassandra</i>, our return fire did apparently
no harm to them.</p>

<p>I hope I may never again feel such an
agony of impatience and doubt and almost
despair, as I beheld my men fall by ones
and twos upon the deck, which soon became
stained and smeared with their blood whilst
the pirate craft came drifting ever nigher
and nigher to us, its decks swarming with
yelling, naked wretches that in their aspect
and manners resembled demons incarnated
rather than mortal men.</p>

<p>"Mr. Langely," said I, in a low voice, "if
those oars are not broken in five minutes'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
time we are all lost." For there yet remained
three thrust through the ports upon
the side nighest to the <i>Cassandra</i>, and the
current was carrying the pirate craft in
such a direction that if they were able to
hold their course a little while longer they
would be almost certain to drift upon us
and so board us.</p>

<p>One minute passed, and two minutes,
then there was a shiver of splinters, and
only one oar was left. Instantly the stern
of the sloop began to swing slowly around
towards us, for one oar was not enough to
keep her to the current. I could see the
ash wood bend with the strain like a willow
twig, then&mdash;snap!&mdash;it broke, and around
came the stern with a swing directly under
our fire. The pirates sprang to the
main-sheets, but it was too late to save
themselves.</p>

<p>When the crew of the <i>Cassandra</i> saw the
result of their fire they burst out shouting
and cheering like madmen. Down came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
the sloop drifting stern on, whilst the <i>Cassandra</i>,
making up for lost time, poured
broadside after broadside into her. Never
did I behold such a sight in all of my life,
for every shot we gave her ploughed great
lanes along her crowded decks. To make
matters worse for them, their mast was presently
shot through, falling alongside in a
great tangled wreck, thus preventing any
man&oelig;uvres which they might still have
hoped to make. They drifted by us at
about forty or fifty yards' distance, shouting
and yelling, and giving us a last broadside
with great courage and determination.
They presently ran aground upon a sandbar
and there stuck fast for the time,
though in such shoal water that we could
not come nigher to them than we then
were.</p>

<p>All this while the barque had been slowly
making her way through the tortuous
turnings of the channel. At one point, the
water being low, she had run aground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
though she had cleared again with the rising
tide, she had been so delayed by this mischance
that she had not been able to come
up in aid of her consort.</p>

<p>But immediately they discerned what mishap
had befallen the sloop, and that she
was fast aground and in no present position
to attack us, they hove to and lay directly
athwart the channel.</p>

<p>I at once perceived their intentions, and
that they were determined to keep us shut
up where we were until the sloop could float
clear away with the rising tide and resume
her attack against us. It was then that the
resolve entered my mind not to await an attack
but to seek it ourselves; for though the
crew of the barque must have outnumbered
that of the <i>Cassandra</i> two to one, she was
yet much the smaller vessel of the two and
the less heavily armed. Now, if we could
only once get past her and safe into the
channel our safety would be wellnigh assured;
for, as said above, the <i>Cassandra</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
was one of the best sailers at the East India
Company's docks.</p>

<p>I turned and beckoned my first mate to
me. "Sir," said I, "yonder is our one and
only chance of getting away; we must run
down upon that vessel in the channel, engage
her, and trust to God and take our
chance of getting safe past her and away.
If we are fortunate enough to pass her we
can gain a good start before she can round
to in such narrow sea-room." Mr. Langely
opened his mouth as though to speak.
"Nay, nay, sir," I cried, "it is our only
chance, and we <i>must</i> take it."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>At first we did not suffer so much as I
had expected from the fire of the pirate; but
when we had come within one hundred or
two hundred yards of them, and when within
range of the musketry in their fore and
main tops, their fire was truly dreadful.</p>

<p>The <i>Cassandra's</i> wheel was stationed under
the overhang of the poop-deck, and upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the helmsman most of their aim was concentrated;
for if the <i>Cassandra</i> was once allowed
to fall off, and should run aground in
the narrow channel, she would then be in
their power, and they could destroy her at
their leisure.</p>

<p>One after another three men fell at that
dangerous post, which was entirely open to
the pirate's fire. We were now within one
hundred and fifty yards of them, and a fourth
took hold, but only for a minute, for he presently
dropped upon his knees, though he
still kept a tight grip on the wheel, keeping
the ship upon her course. Mr. Langely and
I were standing under the overhang of the
poop, whereupon he, seeing that the man
was wounded, without waiting for orders
from me, sprang forward and seized the
wheel in his own hands just as the other
fell forward upon his face.</p>

<p>The next minute Mr. Langely cried out,
"My God, captain, I am shot!" His right
hand fell at his side, and in an instant I beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
his shirt stained with blood that gushed
out from the wound in his shoulder.</p>

<p>The ship beginning to fall off, I ran forward
and took the wheel myself, for in a
minute more, if we held our course, we
would be under the pirate's stern, and in a
position to rake them with our starboard
broadside. I heard a dozen bullets strike
into the wood-work around me; one struck
the wheel, so that I felt as if my hand
and my wrist were paralyzed by the jar.
The next instant I felt a terrible blow upon
my head; a hot red stream gushed over my
face and into my eyes, and for a moment
my brain reeled. Some one caught hold
of me, but just as darkness settled upon me
I felt the ship shake beneath me and heard
the roar of our broadside. We were under
the pirate's stern at last.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>I could not have lain insensible for many
minutes, for when I opened my eyes and
saw the surgeon and my second mate bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
over me, it was still with the roar of
cannon in my ears.</p>

<p>"How is this, Mr. White?" cried I; "are
we not then past the pirate?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said my second mate, in a very serious
voice, "we are run aground."</p>

<p>"And the pirate?" cried I.</p>

<p>"She is also aground," said he, "and we
rake her with every shot."</p>

<p>I got to my feet, in spite of the surgeon's
protest, putting him impatiently aside.</p>

<p>It was as Mr. White said; the pirate was
aground about two or three hundred yards
away from us, fast stuck upon the bar, stern
towards us. She must have received more
than one shot betwixt wind and water, for
she was heeled over to one side, and I could
see a stream of bloody water pouring continually
from her scupper-holes.</p>

<p>But I also saw that we were stuck hard
and fast, and that though our position was
better than theirs, every shot that we fired
drove us with the recoil more firmly aground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
I at once gave orders that all firing except
with muskets should be stopped; so there
we lay aground for more than half an hour,
answering the pirate's fire with our flintlocks.</p>

<p>Although this was dreadful for us to
bear at the time, in the end it proved to be
our salvation; for when the tide raised we
floated clear fully ten minutes before the pirates,
and so escaped immediate destruction.</p>

<p>In the mean time, whilst we lay there the
sloop had floated clear, and the pirates having
cut away the wreck of the main-mast,
and having rigged up oars like those we
had shot away, presently came to the aid of
their consort. Seeing our situation, and
that we were fast aground, they did not attack
us directly, but made for the channel
by the way which they had left it, thus entering
above us and cutting off all our
chance of escape. For though we had so
nearly passed the other craft, we could not
hope to pass them without being boarded,
for with their oars they could come as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
chose, and were not dependent on the
wind.</p>

<p>So soon as they had entered the channel
they laid their course directly for us,
but before they could come up with us, we
also had floated clear, as before stated; and
though we could not escape to the open
water, we were yet enabled to enter the
harbor again, which we did, followed by the
fire of the pirate barque.</p>

<p>The wind now had almost fallen away
again, so that the sloop, driven by her oars,
and enabled by her light draught to cross
the shoals and bars which we could not
make, began to draw up with us, endeavoring
with all diligence to board us. Nevertheless,
we contrived to make a running
fight of it for almost an hour.</p>

<p>At last, the other vessel having repaired
her damages, and having some time since
floated clear off, came down upon us in aid
of her consort, for the sloop was very plainly
filling rapidly, having heeled over so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to one side that her decks were greatly exposed
to our fire.</p>

<p>For all this long time the <i>Greenwich</i> and
Ostender had been riding at about three or
four miles distant, not being able to escape
to open water whilst the pirates held the
channel. But so far from coming to our assistance,
they made no sign of help or fired
so much as a single gun in our aid.</p>

<p>By this time more than half of my officers
and men had been either killed or wounded,
so that when I beheld the barque, crowded
with naked, howling wretches, thirsting for
our blood, come bearing down upon us, and
when I beheld how little hope there was of
Captain Kirby's coming to our assistance,
I could see no other chance for our safety
than to run the <i>Cassandra</i> ashore, and, if
possible, to escape to the beach as best we
could. Accordingly, I gave the necessary
orders to Mr. White, and the <i>Cassandra</i> laid
her course for the beach, closely followed
only by the pirate barque, the sloop having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
already been run ashore about half a mile
below to keep her from sinking.</p>

<p>In five minutes the <i>Cassandra</i> struck,
grounding at about fifty yards from the
shore. The pirate drew fully four feet less
water, but it pleased God that she stuck
fast on higher ground, so that, after all, they
were prevented from boarding us.</p>

<p>Here we fought, for nearly an hour, the
last, and I know not whether it was not the
bloodiest engagement of that whole day;
nor can I sufficiently praise the behavior
not only of the officers, but of the men,
who even in this extremity behaved with
the most extraordinary courage, though the
crew of the sloop supplied the larger vessel
with three boatfuls of fresh men.</p>

<p>Meantime the <i>Greenwich</i> followed the
lead of the Ostender and stood clear away
to sea, leaving us struggling in the very
jaws of death. Soon after the pirate craft
floated clear off with the rising tide, and
immediately fell to work fitting out warps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
to haul out under our stern, though still at
some distance from us.</p>

<p>Seeing this, no hope remained for us
but to leave the ship, if possible, with the
passengers and such of our men as were
still alive, trusting to Providence not only
to bring us safe away, but to keep us all in
that desolate country amongst a strange
and savage people.</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>

<p>As said above, it was now past six o'clock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and Mr. White and the boatswain were the
only unwounded officers with whom I dared
intrust the command of the boats in executing
my plans for leaving the ship.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The long-boat and the gig were all that
remained sound and uninjured, the others
having been shot or stove during the engagement.
It was arranged that Mr. Jeks,
the boatswain, should command the long-boat,
and Mr. White the gig. The passengers
and the less seriously wounded were
to go in the long-boat; Mr. White to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
those who had been more dangerously hurt
in the gig.</p>

<p>By this time the wind had died down
again, and it was as calm as it had been the
two days before, so that the smoke hung
thick about the ship and upon the water,
and did not drift away. Although, because
of this thick cloud, we could not see our
enemy, and so could not point our guns
with any sureness of aim, it also prevented
him from seeing us and what we were about,
so that all our movements were concealed
from him as his were from us.</p>

<p>Mr. Langely having come upon deck at
this time, though very weak and feeble from
the pain of his wound, I intrusted the clearing
away and lowering of the boats to him,
while I went below to advise the women of
our plans, and to tell them to get together
such matters as they might need in this
emergency. I found them in a most pitiable
state, having been sent below at the first
sign of the approaching battle, and left by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
themselves for all this long time with no
light but that of a lantern slung from the
deck above, hearing the uproar of the fight
and the groans of the wounded without once
knowing whether matters were going for us
or against us.</p>

<p>The two ladies sat, or rather crouched,
upon a chest or box, holding one another
by the hand. Mistress Ann lay huddled in
a corner in a most extreme state of terror
and distraction.</p>

<p>I may even yet see in my mind's eye how
Mistress Pamela appeared when I clambered
down the ladder: her face was as
white as marble, and her eyes gazed out
from the shadow of her brows with a most
intense and burning glance. My heart bled
for the poor creatures when I thought how
much they must have suffered since they
were sent to this dreadful place.</p>

<p>So soon as they saw me they fell to
screaming, and clung to one another. Nor
did I wonder at their distraction when I beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
myself a few minutes later in the glass
in my cabin, for my face and hands were
blackened with the smoke of the powder,
my shirt and waistcoat were stained with
the blood which had poured out from the
wound in my head, and around my brow was
bound a bloody napkin which I had hastily
wrapped about my head so soon as I had
recovered from the first effects of my wound.
But just then I knew not how I looked, nor
reckoned anything of it, for in a fight such
as we had passed through one has little
time to think of such matters.</p>

<p>"Ladies," said I, speaking as gently as
I could, "be not afraid; it is I, Captain
Mackra."</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Evans burst into a great passion
of weeping, with her face buried in her
hands, while Mistress Pamela still regarded
me, though with a fixed and stony stare.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" she cried; "and are you
hurt?" And she pointed with her outstretched
finger to my head.</p>

</div>

<p>"Why, no," says I, making shift to force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
a laugh in spite of the anxiety with which I
was consumed; "it is a mere scratch, and
nothing to speak of. There is no time now
to talk of such little matters as this, but
only of leaving the ship, for we can defend
ourselves no longer. Get together what
things you need from your cabin, and make
haste, for there is no time to lose."</p>

<p>I believe that Mistress Ann had fainted
clean away when she had caught sight of
me climbing down the ladder, for we found
that she was in no condition to move, so I
picked her up in my arms and bore her to
the great cabin, the others following close
behind. There I left them and went again
upon deck, where I found that they were
bringing the wounded up from below.</p>

<p>I hope I may never see such a sight again
to the very last day of my life, for it is one
thing to behold a man shot in the heat of
an action, and another and a mightily different
thing to see one of one's own shipmates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
carried groaning in a hammock wet and
stained with his blood.</p>

<p>We had so grounded that we lay within
fifty yards of the shore, and it could take
but a little while for a boat to go thither
and return to the ship again. Nevertheless,
I deemed it necessary to give the Rose of
Paradise into the keeping of some one going
upon this first passage, and upon whom
I could entirely rely. The boatswain had
the care of the women, which was, of course,
of the first importance of all; therefore,
there remained no one in whose hands I
could place it with as much confidence as in
those of Mr. White.</p>

<p>It was very necessary to keep up the show
of fighting, lest the pirates should think we
had surrendered, and so come aboard of
us, but all hands who could be spared from
the guns were engaged in lowering the
wounded into the long-boat and gig.</p>

<p>Leaving Mr. Langely in charge of this,
I took Mr. White into my cabin; there I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
opened the locker that I had made in my
berth, and took out the box containing the
jewel.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I am about to show you a
sign both of my regard and of my esteem.
In this box is a jewel worth above three
hundred thousand pounds; this I intrust
for the present into your keeping. When
you get to the shore you will not return
with the gig, but will remain where you are,
sending the boat back under some one
whom you may choose among your crew.
Should I perish, or should the pirates board
this ship before you return (in which event
I cannot hope to escape with my life), you
will convey this trust to Mr. Longways, the
Company's agent at the king's town. And
now, sir, I wish you God's speed."</p>

<p>Mr. White was about to reply, but I
checked him, telling him that he could best
show his regard for me by leaving the ship
without further words.</p>

<p>We quitted my cabin together, and just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
outside we met Captain Leach, whom I had
noticed repeatedly for the last half-hour,
and never very far away from me. He came
directly towards Mr. White and me, but he
did not so much as glance at the box that
Mr. White held, but spoke to me.</p>

<p>"I came upon Mistress Pamela Boon's
account," said he. "The women are ready
to quit the ship, and Mistress Ann is yet in
a dead swoon."</p>

<p>"I will go to them," said I; and then
turning to Mr. White, I said, very seriously,
"Remember!"</p>

<p>He did not answer, but bowed his head,
and I turned and left him, Captain Leach
following close behind me. He did not enter
with me into the great cabin, but waited
without, and when I came out a few minutes
later I saw that he was gone.</p>

<p>I found the ladies waiting in the cabin,
each with a bundle tied up in a kerchief.
The waiting-woman lay upon the floor, still
in a swoon, with Mistress Pamela kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
beside her, chafing and slapping her hands,
whilst Mrs. Evans sat at the table with her
face buried in her palms. So soon as I entered
Mistress Pamela arose.</p>

<p>"Sir," said she, "Captain Leach told me
he would inform you that we were ready."</p>

<p>"So he did, madam," said I, "and I am
come to help you embark."</p>

<p>As there was no sign of the waiting-woman's
revival from her fit, I was constrained
to carry her upon the deck, as I had already
done from below.</p>

<p>The boat under command of Mr. White
was already gone, for it had taken several
minutes for me to bring the women upon
deck. We stowed them into the long-boat,
and it pushed off immediately and was lost
in the smoke. We then brought up the rest
of the wounded from below, who were those
who had been most desperately hurt in the
action. These we laid upon the deck, so
as to be in readiness for lowering into the
boats so soon as they should return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
In the mean time I had given orders to
those not thus occupied with the wounded
to load many of the guns, with slow-matches
in the breeches to burn from five to ten minutes.
Thus the firing might be kept up after
all had left the ship, whereby we hoped
that the pirates would be stayed a while
from boarding and so discover our absence.
In about ten minutes the gig returned without
Mr. White, and the master's mate, who
was in command in his stead, said that he
had remained ashore with the women, as
I had commanded him. In a very little
while, the long-boat also returning, we
got all hands aboard and pushed off, the
guns still firing now and then as the
slow-matches burned down. So we came
safe to shore, but with no time to spare,
for by the great shouts that were presently
raised we knew that the pirates had
come aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>, and in less
than three minutes after the last man had
quitted her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Not more than fifteen or twenty minutes
had been occupied in making ready and
quitting the ship; for which celerity, and
for the great coolness shown in this trying
emergency, all praise is due both to
the officers and the men. The fight had
lasted for more than four hours and a
half, during which time we had nine men
killed, among whom was the third mate
above mentioned, and twenty-two wounded,
three of whom afterwards died upon
the island.</p>

<p>Besides the clothes and valuables which
many had fetched away with them<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> we had
also brought off with us from the ship a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
quantity of musquets and pistols, and a
dozen or more rounds of ammunition for
each able-bodied man.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> I may say here that I myself was but poorly
equipped in this respect, having not only forgot my
watch, which I had left hanging in my cabin, but being
also without shoes and stockings, which I had stripped
off so that I might more readily swim for it if the pirates
should come aboard whilst the boats were gone
on their first trip to the shore. At the last moment
I was so busied in supervising the lowering of the
wounded into the boats that I did not think of returning
for the one or of securing the other.</p></div>

<p>As soon as we landed we plunged directly
into the thick brush, which there grew
close down to the edge of the beach. Having
thrust our way through these thickets
for some distance, we found the others
waiting for us at a little open space at
the base of three palm-trees which stood
about two hundred yards from the shore,
it being then nigh to sunset, and with but
little chance of the pirates following us that
day.</p>

<p>Mr. White was standing near my passengers,
who were gathered together in a group,
but one of them was missing. <i>It was Captain
Leach.</i></p>

<p>"And where is Captain Leach?" I cried,
looking directly at Mr. White.</p>

<p>He gazed at me in an exceedingly strange
manner, and I saw that he grew as pale as
death to the very lips. "And did he not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
come in the boat with you, sir?" said he at
last, in a low and husky voice.</p>

<p>At these words a terrible fear came over
me. "Where is the box I gave you?" I
cried; and seeing that he was not like to
answer, repeated the question&mdash;"Where is
the box I gave you?"</p>

<p>By way of reply Mr. White fumbled for a
moment or two in his waistcoat-pocket, and
presently handed me a scrap of paper. I
opened it, and tried to read, though my
hand trembled so that I could hardly contrive
to make out what it was. But in spite
of that, and the blurring of my eyesight,
every word and every letter is stamped upon
my memory as upon a plate of brass.</p>

<p>It was written as though in mine own
handwriting, and very hastily scrawled, but
so like that I could not have told it myself
had I not known it to be a forgery.</p>

<p>These were the words:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "<i>Sir,&mdash;I have altered my mind in regard to the box. Please deliver
it to the bearer (Captain Leach), who will take present charge of
it, and will convey it to me.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-right: 10%; text-align:right;">"<span class="smcap">John Mackra</span>."</p>

<p>As I still held the letter in my hand, gazing
stupidly at it, but seeing nothing, the
whole villany of the business was, as it were,
revealed to me. I saw that when Captain
Leach had left the ship in the native canoe
two nights ago he had come straight to the
pirates and had made some bargain with
them for that accursed Rose of Paradise;
that when he had gone aboard the <i>Greenwich</i>
and the Ostender the next day, it was not to
secure a passage for himself, but rather to persuade
them to sacrifice the <i>Cassandra</i>, and
so save their own wretched hulks; that when
he had sent me to the women in the great
cabin it was to get rid of me so that he
might tamper with Mr. White; and last of
all, that he had kept this forged letter about
him for just such an occasion as this. Then
I thought of my shipmates killed and wounded,
of my vessel and cargo lost, of all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
poor people outcasts upon this savage, desert
coast, with no present prospect or hope
of help, and of the stone itself thus cheated
out of my hands at the last moment, and
after all the suffering and the blood that
had been shed. There came a great roaring
in mine ears, all things began to reel
before my sight, a dark cloud seemed to
encompass me, and then I knew nothing
more.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>X.</h2>

<p>After I had thus swooned away, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
happened both from the fever of my wound
and the loss of blood, there followed a long
time during which everything was confused
and dream-like. I may call to mind what
seemed to me a great and toilsome journey,
but so commingled with the visions of my
fever that I knew not whether it had taken
hours, days, or weeks, and of which I may
remember almost nothing. After that I
have a memory of tossing upon a pallet
which was both rough and hard, of a darkened
and silent room, and of people coming
and going and talking in whispers. Then
one morning I awoke as though from a deep
sleep, and felt that the heat of the fever had
left me, though mightily weak and weary.
This awakening must have happened betwixt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
four and five o'clock in the morning,
for the mat which hung at the door had
been raised, and a cool and refreshing breeze
swept through the mud hut.</p>

<p>I lay for a long time looking out of the
door towards which my couch was facing,
and through which I could see hillocks of
gray sand intermingled with rich and luxuriant
vegetation; beyond, the rim of the
ocean stretched like a black thread against
the gray sky. I gave no thought to anything,
but lay quite still, feeling mighty
peaceful and quiet. By-and-by I turned
mine eyes and saw that some one sat beside
me, and that it was Mr. White. He did not
see that I was observing him, but sat reading
his Bible, for he was a young man of
great earnestness of spirit. The sight of
him brought first one thing and then another
back to my memory, until the whole
was complete as I have told it.</p>

<p>"Mr. White," said I. I spoke very quietly,
but he could not have started more violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
had a clap of thunder sounded from
the sky. He came straight to me, and laid
his hand upon my forehead. "Yes," said I,
making shift to smile, "the fever has left me
now; and will you tell me where I am?"</p>

<p>"Sir," says he, "you are safe, and in the
king's town; and now I will go and tell the
surgeon of the bettering of your condition."
So saying he left me, and Mr. Greenacre,
the surgeon, presently came to me. He
told me that all hands had been brought
safe to the king's town; that I might set
my mind at rest both regarding the passengers
and the crew; and that I must not now
talk further, but should seek to rest myself,
which was very necessary for me to do in
my present condition. Nor was I inclined
to disobey this command, but presently
closed mine eyes and fell into a most refreshing
slumber, from which I did not
awake until nigh sunset, when I found that
Mr. White was once more beside me. When
he saw that I was awake he made as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
would again go and call the surgeon, but I
stopped him from doing as he intended.</p>

<p>"Stay, Mr. White," said I. "I should like
now to know something more of what has
happened. How long have I been lying in
this condition?"</p>

<p>"About six days, sir," said he. And then,
in a trembling voice, "Oh, Captain Mackra,
can you forgive me for the injury I have
done?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," said I, "I have nothing to
forgive, nor have you done anything for
which to beseech forgiveness. What you
did you did with the best intent; nor can
I blame you for being so deceived by such
a wicked and cunning villain as Captain
Leach. And now tell me, what news is
there of the pirates?" To this he answered
that they were still lying at anchor in the
bay on the east side of the island, repairing
the damages which we had wrought; that
the chief or them was one Edward England,
a fellow of great note among these wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
villains; that they had been so enraged at
that bloody fight, which had cost them so
dear, that they had set a reward of two thousand
pounds upon my head; and that the
king of the island had offered us his protection,
and had undertaken to guard us securely
from any attack the pirates might be
inclined to make against us. But, nevertheless,
lest any of the natives should be of a
mind to betray me for this great and magnificent
reward, it had been deemed best
that it should be reported that I had been
killed in the late engagement.</p>

<p>After having recounted these things as
briefly as possible, Mr. White again went in
search of the surgeon, who soon came, and
put a very cheerful face upon my case, which
he said was now without doubt upon the
mend.</p>

<p>After having eaten a very hearty supper
of rich and savory broth, I was so far refreshed
as to be able to receive some few
who particularly desired to have speech with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
me, and who were presently ushered in by
Mr. Greenacre.</p>

<p>The first to come was my former acquaintance,
Mr. Longways, the Company's
agent, and with him a great tall native chief,
who had rather the appearance of a Malay
than an African negro, and who was none
other than King Kulakula himself. With
these two came a black interpreter from
Mozambique, for King Coffee could not
speak one single word of English, but only
a little Dutch, which he had picked up from
the traders along the coast.</p>

<p>After them came the two ladies, escorted
by Mr. Langely, who had now so far recovered
from his wound as to be able to be
about with ease, although he still carried his
arm in a sling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Evans, when she saw me, gushed into
tears, but Mistress Pamela came straight to
me, took my hand, and set it to her lips,
though I strove my best to stay her from
doing so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
"Sir," said she, "what do we not owe to
our brave preserver, who hath brought us
safe through all this great trouble!"</p>

<p>"No, madam," cried I, hastily, for I could
not bear that she should lay credit to me,
who had so little earned it, seeing how helpless
I had been in bringing them safe off
from the <i>Cassandra</i>&mdash;"no, madam, give no
credit to me; give it first of all to God, and
then to Mr. Langely, who, though so sorely
wounded, brought you, I understand, safe
through the wilderness to this place."</p>

<p>After they had so spoken, comes King
Kulakula forward with the interpreter, and
through the black man expressed many kind
and condescending wishes for the continued
bettering of my condition. He furthermore
gave me every assurance that we should all
be protected from our enemies so long as
we chose to remain at that place.</p>

<p>After a little while my visitors left me, except
Mr. Longways, who, by permission of
the surgeon, remained behind to exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
a few words with me. I then observed for
the first time how sadly different he was in
his appearance from what he had been; for
the jauntiness of his carriage was gone, and
he looked mightily perturbed in his spirits.</p>

<p>So soon as he had made sure that no one
was by to overhear us, he began without preface
to talk about the Rose of Paradise, saying
that Mr. White had told him that it had
been lost, and also some details of the matter;
that that loss meant ruin to him, who
could say no word in his own defence excepting
by letter, while I had every opportunity
of stating my case in my own fashion
to the East India Company when I should
come home, and so clear myself and leave
him in the mire. But in spite of that it was
his opinion that even I, with all these advantages
in my favor, would have great trouble
in making matters straight; for the loss
of three hundred thousand pounds, besides
my ship and cargo, was a thing that was not
likely to be passed over very lightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
I could hardly forbear smiling at this discourse,
although it was of such a serious
nature, for it seemed very strange to me
that Mr. Longways should so readily suspect
me of being disposed to ruin him.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I know not what you
would do in such a case as this, but I tell
you plain that if I am compelled to make
an unfortunate report to the East India
Company, I will make it without blaming
you or myself or any one, but simply tell the
truth, and so let them adjudge the matter as
they see fit."</p>

<p>"That is it, sir," cried he&mdash;"that is it, sir.
If the Company are informed that I betrayed
this important secret to Captain
Leach, I'll have to whistle for it a long time
out in the cold before I get a snug berth
with them again."</p>

<p>"I am mightily sorry for you," said I,
gravely. "But of course, sir, that is a matter
concerning which you alone are responsible.
Nevertheless, I must tell you that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
am not inclined to leave this place without
endeavoring to recover that which has been
so unfortunately lost."</p>

<p>"What, sir!" he cried; "do you mean to
say that you will undertake to recover the
Rose of Paradise again? And how do you
purpose doing it, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"You may ask, sir," says I, smiling; "but
as for my telling you, why, that is a very
different matter."</p>

<p>Yet I had determined upon one point almost
as soon as Mr. White had informed
me who was the pirate captain into whose
hands the <i>Cassandra</i> had fallen, and that
was to go aboard of the pirate craft, and to
speak with Captain Edward England himself.
I had known him before he had entered
into the nefarious life which he now
followed, and while he was still first mate
of the <i>Lady Alice</i>. I was then with Captain
Wraxel in the West Indies, and had
met England at Kingston, in the island of
Jamaica, upon which occasion he had appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
to conceive quite a liking for me,
though I cannot say it was returned in
kind. I knew him as a wild and reckless
blade, but neither blood-thirsty nor cruel,
and making every allowance for the change
in his nature which this wicked life might
effect, I did not believe that injury would
happen to me if I could once gain his promise
of safety in visiting his ship.</p>

<p>As for the jewel, I did not believe that
Captain Leach would disclose the secret of
it without he had been compelled to do so;
wherefore, if he had it still in his own keeping,
I entertained a hope that I might by
some trick or other snatch the precious
stone away from him again. In that event
I did not believe he would say anything, for
fear that the pirates might punish him for
keeping it a secret from them.</p>

<p>But although I could perceive, as Mr.
Longways had said, that it was of great
importance both to his future and mine
own that the Rose of Paradise should be regained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
I ventured my life not so much in
the hope of obtaining the stone as of procuring
some means by which all hands
might be able to quit the island; for we&mdash;and
more especially the women&mdash;could not
but be in constant danger from the bloody
wretches thirsting for revenge on account
of the check which we of the <i>Cassandra</i>
had lately put upon them. Wherefore I
thought it best that I should boldly visit
the pirate captain, for I had great hopes of
being able to persuade him to allow us to
escape, and even of procuring from him
some means to that end.</p>

<p>In any case, the venture could not but be
of advantage to us, for even if I should perish,
their revenge might thereby be satisfied,
and they might depart without molesting
the rest of the ship's company, for they were
pleased to regard me as the chief cause of
all their mishaps in the late engagement.</p>

<p>Before I dared venture aboard the pirate
craft it was necessary that I should first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
write a letter to the captain, and also that
I should have a trustworthy person to convey
my communication to him; nor did I
give two thoughts to this matter, for common
justice pointed to Mr. White as the
only fitting one to be my messenger; accordingly
I sent for him, and he soon came.
I told him that I desired to open communication
with the pirate captain upon a matter
of great importance, and that I gave him
this opportunity towards redeeming his self-respect
by conveying my message to Captain
England. Nor have I ever seen a man
more grateful than Mr. White upon this
occasion; two or three times he strove to
speak, and when he did contrive to do so it
was only simply to say, "Sir, I thank you."</p>

<p>The surgeon having given me permission,
I wrote my letter, and Mr. White took it that
very night, having no companion with him
but two natives who acted as guides. I have
a copy of the letter, made at the time, which
runs as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"To Captain Edward England:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Sir,&mdash;I write you this in a most forlorn and
distressing situation.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Having defended ourselves, our ship, and those
intrusted to our keeping, from you, who sought to
encompass our destruction by all means in your
power, we now find ourselves reduced to the necessity
of imploring aid from you, who so lately sought
our lives. Nor would we even yet ask anything
from you were it not for three poor and helpless
women, whose safety here is a matter of uncertainty
from day to day, and who, without aid is
extended to them, may perish miserably in this
desolate and savage land.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Sir, though a wild and ungoverned nature, I
never knew you to be a cruel man; therefore I ask
this aid of you for the sake of these three women.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Furthermore, I ask that you do not hastily refuse
this plea for aid, but may allow me to come
aboard of your craft and speak to you in person.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"I know that there is with you one who is mine
enemy, because of a great injury which he hath
done me, and who will no doubt conspire against
my life&mdash;I mean Captain Leach, lately one of my
passengers, and who, I suspect, along with others,
betrayed us into your hands. But although I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
he would seek my life, yet I am willing to
trust it into your hands if you will promise me
safety in my coming and my going.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Sir, I beseech you to grant me this speech with
you, that I may plead the cause of the weak and

<h2>XI.</h2>

<p>Mr. White was only gone for a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
more than two days, and when he returned
he brought with him a letter from the pirate
captain. The communication ran thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"To Captain John Mackra, late of the 'Cassandra:'</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Sir,&mdash;If you choose to risk your life by coming
hither, devil a word have I to say against it.
They're a wild set of blades under me, and mind
the helm no better than a washing-tub, so that my
orders have little or no weight with them. All the
same, if you're the man to come aboard, and have
the courage to face the matter out, I'll do what I
can to see that no harm happens to you. But if
you'll take a friend's advice you'll stay where you
are, and let a bad matter cure itself, for you know
very well that there is no use splicing a rotten rope.
As for the pickle you're in, lay that to your luck,
and not to me.</i></p>

<p style="margin-right: 10%; text-align:right;">"<span class="smcap">Edward England</span>."</p>

<p>I was none too well pleased with this precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
epistle, for I could see very readily
how little command Captain England held
upon the wretches under him. Nevertheless,
it did not alter my determination to
to go aboard of the pirate craft and to speak
with him. I was the more inclined to do
this as I felt well assured that the pirates
could not now be as hot for my blood as
they had been at first.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>It was necessary for me to get away from
the king's town without confiding my determination
to any one, or any one having
knowledge of my departure, for I knew very
well that there was not one of my officers
but would have stayed me from acting on
my plans had they been informed of them,
even if they should find it needful to use
force to prevent my going.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the eighth day since
the fight when Mr. White returned with
Captain England's letter, and I determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
that that very night should witness my departure
upon my enterprise, which to one
looking coolly upon it might seem little if
any better than the frantic act of a madman.
Nor was it that I myself was unconscious
of the magnitude of these dangers,
for I entered upon them only because that
in the desperate state of our necessities I
could see no other course out of our difficulties,
and so had to choose this for lack
of a better. Accordingly, as said above, I
determined to set out that very night, for
nothing could be gained by further delay.</p>

<p>There was no other choice left me but to
make my way along the beach, which, although
it would increase the distance by
five or six miles, would yet afford me a
sound and level highway for my journeying,
the sand being firm and hard when the
water was out at low tide.</p>

<p>That night I wrote a lengthy letter to
Mr. Langely, giving him full particulars as
to what I was about to undertake, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
instructions as to how he should proceed in
the event of my not returning from my adventure.
I also wrote my will, and settled
all my affairs as well as I was able. This
took until nigh midnight.</p>

<p>All this I managed to do without the
knowledge of any one, and by the light of a
little wick floating in a dish of oil, the flame
of which I kept so well shaded that no one
perceived it in all that time.</p>

<p>About one o'clock I came out from my
hut, and found the stars shining most beautifully
in the sky, and all the air full of the
noises of the night. I did not tarry, however,
but walked straight to the beach, and
along it towards the northern end of the
island, around which and beyond the cape
I knew the bay to lie, about ten leagues distant
from the king's town.</p>

<p>I had only been twice upon my feet since
the fever had left me, and found that I was
far more weak than I had supposed myself
to be, so that I had to rest myself at frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
intervals. However, I managed to
cover some ten miles of my journey by
about six o'clock in the morning, by which
time I was so exhausted that I could go
no farther, but had to lie down under the
shade of the bushes and rest myself for a
long time.</p>

<p>I speak of these things to show why it
was that my journey should have occupied
nigh upon two days, for it was not until the
afternoon of the second day that I came
within sight of a boat, drawn up on the
beach, which I knew to belong to the pirates,
and from which the crew had gone
into the thickets, either to search for game
or for water.</p>

<p>I had eaten nothing all that day, for I
had not thought that my journey would
have taken me so long, and I did not care
to burden myself with any more food than
necessary. So I was glad to see the boat,
not only being very weary, but also having
my feet so badly blistered by the unwonted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
exposure to the hot sun on the bare sand
that it was only with pain that I could take
a single step.</p>

<p>As I drew nigh, two fellows who had been
lying in the shade upon the further side
sprang to their feet and hailed me.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" says one of them&mdash;a
great black-bearded fellow with a dirty yellow
handkerchief tied around his head, a
ragged scarf about his loins, a brace of pistols
hanging from a leathern belt, and a
dirty shirt opened at the breast, showing a
hairy throat and chest.</p>

<p>"I am Captain John Mackra," said I, and
I sat down upon the gunwale of the boat,
for I could go no farther.</p>

</div>

<p>"The devil you are!" says he, and he
stared at me from top to toe as though I
had been some strange creature the like of
which he had never beheld before. Then,
without another word, he put his fingers to
his lips and gave a great, long, shrill whistle.
I presently heard a great crackling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
bushes and the noise of loud voices, and
soon there burst out of the thickets six or
eight great, bearded, dirty, villanous rascals,
who came running down to the boat, having
caught sight of me, and knowing me to
be a stranger. "It's Captain Leach," said the
one of the pirates who had not yet spoken&mdash;a
young fellow of not more than twenty.</p>

<p>Some of those who had just come had
been drinking, as could be very plainly seen
from the way in which they acted. One of
them was for killing me off-hand, and I verily
believe would have done so, in spite of all
that the others could do or say, had not another
of them knocked him down with an
oar with such a blow that I thought at first
the fellow had been killed outright.</p>

<p>After that they bound me hand and foot,
and chucked me into the stern-sheets of the
boat along with the fellow who had been
knocked down by the oar, and who lay without
life or motion, as though neither were
of more account than so much old junk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
After that they shoved off from the beach
in the direction of my old craft the <i>Cassandra</i>,
which rode at anchor about a mile and
a half or two miles away.</p>

<p>The boat had hardly come alongside when
the news of my coming ran fore and aft like
a train of powder. They hoisted me upon
deck and laid me just aft of the main-mast,
whilst a great crowd gathered round me
and stared at me, some of them grinning
and some of them cursing me.</p>

<p>Most of them were more or less in liquor,
and it was this circumstance that came nigh
to costing me my life, and this was how it
happened:</p>

<p>One great fellow with a dreadful scar
across his face gave me a kick in the loins
which I thought at first had finished me,
and for no cause that I could see but that
he was drunk and in a savage humor. One
or two of them sang out to him not to kill
me just then, but he made no answer except
by aiming another kick at my head, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
I warded off with my arm so that it did me
little or no harm. He drew back his foot
for another blow, but just then an iron belaying-pin
came whizzing through the air
and struck the fellow in the jaw, knocking
him down upon the deck as though he had
been shot.</p>

<p>I turned mine eyes and saw that it was
Captain England himself who had struck
the blow.</p>

<p>"Look 'ee," says he, "we'll have none of
this; if killing is to be done, it is to be done
lawyer-like. He's come aboard himself, and
if he's to be killed he's to be killed after his
trial, and not before."</p>

<p>There was a moment or two of pause, for
Captain England had drawn a brace of pistols,
and held one cocked in either hand;
but just then up stepped a fellow who it was
very plain to see was of some account
amongst them, for his clothes were of rich
stuff, and he had a gold chain with a cross
slung around his neck, and golden ear-rings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in his ears. He walked up to England until
he stood face to face with him.</p>

<p>"Look 'ee, Ned England," says he, "what
I've got to say is this: you're carrying
things with too high a hand to suit us easy&ndash;going
fellows. D'ye think you're king or
emperor, and that we're nigger slaves, that
you knock us about as it suits your humor?"</p>

<p>I had expected that England would have
shot the fellow down where he stood, but
he stayed his hand, and by the muttering
of the rest I knew that the speaker carried
most of them with him.</p>

<p>"Look 'ee, now," says he, more boldly,
"didn't we choose you for our captain ourselves?
And here you knock us around
with belaying-pins as though you owned
every man of us; and all for what? Why,
for giving this here precious sea-captain an
innocent kick or two for all of the good
fellows he's sent to h&mdash;ll since ten days ago.
What I say is, hang him up to the yard-arm;"
and he fetched me a terrible kick in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the side without taking his eyes from his
captain's face.</p>

<p>At this time, although I heard what was
said, I thought but little of what was passing
about me, my mind being beclouded
with my weakness and my pains, for I had
wellnigh swooned from the agony of those
two kicks upon my flank and loins. Therefore
I lay with mine eyes shut, feeling deathly
sick and faint.</p>

<p>A time of silence followed, though how
long it might be I could not exactly tell.
Then I heard Captain England speak, the
words coming to my ears as though from a
great distance, because of my condition.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you, Burke, what do I care for the
fellow? If you want the man's life, take it!"
and I knew that he swung upon his heel
and walked away.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>XII.</h2>

<p>I could not at that minute see that anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
stood between me and death, for the
pirates were so bent upon my immediate
destruction that they set about getting ready
a line to hang me up without more ado.</p>

<p>Yet though I had cause to apprehend
that the very next moment would be my
last upon earth, the dread of death was in
no wise keen upon me, for in my half-swoon
I lay as one in a dream, and neither saw nor
heard very clearly the preparations they
were making for my destruction, and so was
mercifully spared that pain. But God in
His great mercy determined it otherwise
than was the intention of these wicked men,
for just at that moment some one forward
began bawling out, in a great hoarse voice,
"Where is Jack Mackra? Where is he, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
say? Show him to me! &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;
ye! out of my way, and let me get at him!"</p>

<p>As I might turn my head, I looked
whence my voice came, and there saw, as in
a dream, a great, tall, lantern-jawed man,
with a patch over one eye and a crutch under
his left arm. In his right hand he held
a long sharp knife, with which he jabbed at
those who stood in his way, so that they
were glad enough to make room for him,
one or two of them cursing him, the others
grinning and laughing as though it were all
a fine piece of sport. As those around me
drew aside I beheld him more plainly; his
left leg had been cut off at the knee, he was
loose-jointed and ungainly, and he had one
of the most villanous countenances that it
was ever my fortune to look into. I could
also see that he, like many of the others,
had been drinking. It was very plain that
he was a great favorite amongst the rest, for
they made room for him and took all his
curses and many blows, which he gave with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
his crutch, without either answering him or
striving to defend themselves. Even the
fellow who had spoken so boldly to the captain's
face, and whom I afterwards found
to be the chief of the "lords," as they are
pleased to call those in authority amongst
them, grinned and stood aside as the villanous
cripple came and leaned over me.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you," says he, "and is it you, Jack
Mackra? Then I have a score to pay you
that has stood on the slate for this many a
day."</p>

<p>He turned me over upon my face with
his crutch, and the next moment I felt the
cords that tied my hands give way, and
knew that they had been cut, then my legs
and feet were loosened from their lashings,
and I was a free man. I heard the fellow
say, "Get up!" whereupon I stood upon
my feet and gazed about me, though my
brain still swam, and all things appeared
blurred and distorted to my sight, the sky
and the sea and the faces around me being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
all strangely mingled together. Then presently,
as my confusion began to fade away
from me, I heard the one-legged man speaking
to me.</p>

<p>"And do you know who I am?" said he.</p>

<p>"No," says I, at last gathering my wits to
speak; "I cannot bring you to mind."</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "don't you remember
Jimmy Ward, the cook aboard the <i>Pembroke
Castle</i>&mdash;him as you saved from five
drunken Spanish devils over at Honduras?
Hey? don't you mind how they had me
down under the table, jabbing at me with
their d&mdash;d snickershees and swearing that
they would cut the living heart out of me?
If it hadn't been for you, it would have been
all over with Jimmy Ward at that time."
He waited for an answer, but as yet I could
say nothing. "Well, I haven't forgot it if
you have," he continued; "I owe you a
good turn, and I'll pay it if I have to bleed
for it."</p>

<p>Just then up steps the fellow who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
faced England so boldly a moment or two
before. "Come, come, Jimmy," says he, "a
joke's a joke, and I can laugh as loud as
any; but here's a man has done us more
damage than anybody we've fell in with
since we ran foul of the <i>Eagle</i>."</p>

<p>"Hang him up!" Hang him up!" sang
out several of those who stood around, and
I verily believe the business would have
gone against me, after all, only for Captain
England, who must have been near for all
this time, and who came to the aid of the
cripple. Both together, they contrived so
to argue and talk and threaten the others
that the end of the matter was they led me
off to the captain's cabin, the one on one
side of me and the other on the other, whilst
the crowd followed behind, though they
came no further than the door, which was
clapped to in their faces.</p>

<p>"You've had a narrow miss of it," says
England, so soon as we were come fairly
within and had sat down, "and you've nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to thank for it but yourself, for if you'd
minded what I told you you'd have staid
where you were and let your bad luck sail
her own craft without putting your hand to
the helm. Even yet I don't know if we'll
be able to get you off, for Tom Burke is
hot for your blood, and will get it if he's
able."</p>

<p>"That he will," says Ward; "for he's not
the man to give up what he's laid his hand
to."</p>

<p>"Have you had anything to eat?" said
England, presently.</p>

<p>"Not since five o'clock this morning,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "you'll have to be fed,
whether they hang you or no." Whereupon
he fetched out from a locker a great lot of
biscuit and a decanter of the very port-wine
with which I had entertained Mr. Longways
when he came aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>
with The Rose of Paradise; nor have I ever
tasted food that was more refreshing than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
that which I then ate, for I was wellnigh
exhausted with hunger.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a while, and England
walked up and down the cabin with his
hands clasped behind his back. During all
this time I had been looking around me,
and of a sudden my heart seemed to leap
into my throat, for in the corner of the
cabin, lying amongst a lot of litter, where it
seemed to have been flung as of no account,
I saw the iron despatch-box.</p>

<p>My danger had been so great and my
mind in such a maze for all this time that
there had been no room in my brain for
other matters, the very objects of my adventure
having been forgotten for a while;
but with the sight of this everything came
back to me with a rush, and I wondered for
the first time that I had not yet seen my
betrayer.</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Leach?" said I to
England.</p>

<p>He stopped short in his walk, and regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
me with a very strange expression,
which at the time I could in no wise understand.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, presently, "he was shot&mdash;shot
by accident&mdash;when we first came
aboard of this here craft after you left
her."</p>

<p>I sat silent for a great long time after
this, nor could I think of one word to say,
for of all the things which my mind had
forecasted, this was the very furthest from
my imaginings. So I sat staring at the pirate
captain, who, upon his part, sat gazing
back again at me, answering my look with
a grin. I had been well assured that Captain
Leach had stolen the jewel, but was it
possible that I had misjudged him in suspecting
that he had betrayed us to the pirates,
and that they, finding him alive upon
the vessel, whence he had not had sufficient
time to escape, had thereupon instantly murthered
him, as is their custom upon such
occasions?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
"And tell me this," said I at last, "was it
through Captain Leach's machinations that
we were betrayed into your hands?"</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "I may tell you plain, if
I had never met Captain Leach I should
never have ventured into this harbor in the
face of three armed vessels lying across the
channel."</p>

<p>"Then I was not mistaken," said I. But
I dared ask no more questions, lest the pirate
captain's suspicions should be aroused,
for, from the appearance of the despatch-box,
which did not yet seem to have been
tampered with, but rather held as of no account
whatever, I did not believe that Captain
Leach had betrayed the presence of
the jewel to the pirate, but rather had reserved
the secret for his own advantage,
which, indeed, was the most likely supposition
that could be imagined. If now I could
but by some means or other contrive to find
opportunity to examine the box, I could
very speedily tell whether the lock had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
forced; which would, in my estimation, decide
whether or not the jewel was still safe
and undiscovered.</p>

<p>Presently Ward spoke. "And how," said
he, "did you come to get into such a pickle
as I found you, sir?"</p>

<p>I told him the main reason for my visit
in as few words and with as little circumlocution
as possible; how I had entertained
hopes of procuring a promise of safety for
my passengers and ship's crew, and even
possibly of obtaining some means of transportation
from the place where they now
were to one of greater ease and security.
Both men listened without a word to what
I said, and when I had ended Ward pursed
his mouth up in a most comical fashion,
and gave a great long whistle, half under
his breath, regarding me the while with his
one eye as round as a saucer.</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say," says he, "that
you, a sick man, have gone and travelled
ten leagues all for to give yourself up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
such a gang of bloody cutthroats as we
be?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," says I; "sure ten leagues is
not such a long journey that one need make
much of a stir about it."</p>

<p>"Ten leagues be blowed!" says he. "Suppose
they had shot you dead when they had
found out who you were; what then?"</p>

<p>"But they did not shoot me," said I.</p>

<p>"But perhaps they may kill you yet," put
in England.</p>

<p>"That matter is neither in your hands
nor mine," said I.</p>

<p>Ward looked in a very droll manner, first
at England and then at me. "Well, I'm
blowed!" he said at last.</p>

<p>At this Captain England burst into a
great loud laugh. "Why," says he, "it
would be a vast pity to let a man of such
spirit lose his life after all. What d'ye say,
Ward?"</p>

<p>"I say yes," said Ward, and he thumped
his fist down on the table; "and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Eternal he shall get what he wants&mdash;in reason&mdash;Tom
Burke and the devil notwithstanding!"</p>

<p>"Come," says England; "come, Ward,
we'll go and fetch Burke in, and see if we
can't drink him into a good humor." And
so saying both men went out of the cabin,
shutting the door behind them. As soon
as their backs were turned I sprang to
where the despatch-box lay, snatched it up,
and began eagerly examining it. It was
still securely locked; the lid had not been
forced, and I could see no marks of violence
upon it. But I had just then but short time
for such an examination, for in a little while
I heard footsteps outside, whereupon I replaced
the box where I had found it and
resumed my chair, composing my countenance
as far as I was able to do. Presently
I heard voices at the door, and from their
tones I could gather that Captain England
and the crippled cook were trying to persuade
Burke to come into the cabin, he being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
mightily unwilling to do so. For a
while they held the door ajar, and I could
hear Burke cursing and swearing at a great
rate, and calling Heaven to witness that he
would have my life before he was done with
me. Meantime the others were busied in
talking to him, and soothing him, and reasoning
with him, but all to no purpose.
No; he would come in and drink a glass of
grog with them, if that was what they were
after, but he would have my life&mdash;yes, he
would; and he was not to be wheedled out
of his purpose by soft words either. So
they, after a while, all came into the cabin
and sat down to the table, though Burke
never so much as turned his eyes in my
direction.</p>

<p>Captain England brought out a bottle of
Jamaica, which he set upon the board, and
each of the three pirates mixed himself a
glass of grog. Burke drank three or four
glasses of the stuff without its seeming in
the least to smooth his ill-temper. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
cripple kept pace with him in his drinking,
at which I was mightily anxious, for when
such bloody wretches as they become heated
with liquor, it is a toss of a farthing whether
they murder a man in their sport or lavish
caresses upon him. However, I was
glad to see that Captain England drank
but sparingly, wherefore I entertained great
hopes that he would remain sufficiently cool
to prevent any violence being used against
me.</p>

<p>But I greatly doubt that my life would
have been in danger under any circumstances,
for after a while, as Burke became
more warmed in his cups, his displeasure
against me became more and more softened.
At first, without speaking directly to me,
he began, with many imprecations upon his
own head, to say that though he was a
bloody sea-pirate, and a murderer, and a
thief, he knew a man of courage when he
saw him, and loved him as his brother. By-and-by
he insisted upon shaking hands with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
me across the table, swearing that if harm
had happened to me through him he would
have repented it to the very last day of his
life. I now perceived that the time had
come for me to act; accordingly I began,
first by hints and afterwards by direct appeals,
to beseech them that they would give
me the smaller of their two crafts, which
had been so injured in the late engagement
that it was still lying upon the beach where
they had run it aground, and from which
position they had made no efforts to rescue
it. I had noticed the craft as I came down
the beach, and though I observed that she
had been very much shattered by the broadsides
which we had fired into her, I yet had
hopes that if I could get possession of her
I might be able to patch her up sufficiently
to transport my passengers and crew to
some place of greater security than the island
offered, even perhaps to Bombay, weather
permitting. I had thought that the pirates
would have made some objection, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
believe that even England himself was startled
at the boldness of my request, for he
looked anxiously at the others, but ventured
nothing. However, I think that that very
boldness recommended itself to these reckless
spirits, for they granted what I desired
with hardly a word of objection. Emboldened
by this, I went still further, and besought
them to give me back some of the
cargo which they had captured along with
the <i>Cassandra</i>.</p>

<p>At this, though he said nothing, Captain
England grinned as though vastly amused.
Nor was I wrong in venturing such a seemingly
foolhardy request, for not only did
they promise to give me back one hundred
and twenty-nine bales of the Company's
goods, but also gave me a written agreement
to that effect, which they each of them
signed, Captain England first of all.</p>

<p>I may say here that though it might seem
absurd to set any value upon a mere written
agreement signed by such bloody and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
lawless men, it was really of very great moment,
for these fellows have a vast respect
and regard for any instrument to which
they set their hand, wherefore I knew that
the chances were many to one that they
would do as they promised, after once having
superscribed to it.</p>

<p>Then, with my heart beating so that I
could hardly speak, I turned to Captain
England. "And you, sir," said I, "will you
grant me one small favor?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon what it is," says he.</p>

<p>I looked at him steadily for a moment or
two whilst I was collecting myself; then I
spoke with all the coolness I could command,
although I felt that I could scarcely
forbear trembling at this trying moment.
"Why, sir," says I, "if my despatches are
lost, I can make but a poor sort of a report
to the Honorable Company."</p>

<p>"Well, John Mackra, and how can I help
you in that?" said he, very coolly.</p>

<p>"Easily enough," said I. "Yonder is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
despatch-box in the corner, which can be of
but little use to you, and yet it is of great
import to me."</p>

<p>"And you want it?" says he.</p>

<p>"Indeed yes," said I, "though of course
that is as you please."</p>

<p>He regarded me for a while in silence,
his head upon one side, and his face twisted
up into a most droll, quizzical, cunning
expression, of which I could make nothing
whatever.</p>

<p>"And is that all that you want of me?"
said he.</p>

<p>I nodded my head, for I could not trust
myself to speak.</p>

<p>Upon this he burst suddenly into a great
loud laugh, and gave the table a thump
with his fist which made the glasses jingle.
I sat regarding him, not knowing what to
make of it all; but his next words were a
vast relief to me.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "I thought you were
going to ask me for something of some account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
If that is all you want, it is yours,
and welcome to it."</p>

<p>Finding all three of the pirates to be in
such a complacent mood, I asked them for
some of my clothes, for those that I had
hung in tatters about me, and, as said before,
I was in my bare feet. But this they
would not do, Master Burke asking me
whether they had not granted enough already,
without giving me togs to cover my
bloody carcass. Upon this I perceived that
I had gotten all that I was likely to obtain,
and so had to go without my clothes.</p>

<p>The pirates were for keeping me on board
all night, that they might, as they were
pleased to say, entertain me in a decent
fashion. But I, having gained possession
of the precious despatch-box, and trembling
with anxiety lest by some sudden shift of
luck it should be taken away from me again,
was most eagerly anxious to take myself
away. England himself urged my departure.
So about seven o'clock I was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
ashore, with the despatch-box in my possession,
giving thanks that I had come off from
my adventure with such exceeding good
fortune, for I felt that I had not only recovered
the most precious prize of all, but
England had promised to do his uttermost
to hold the others to their written agreement,
saying that if he were successful he
would depart in two days, leaving the bales
of goods behind upon the shore.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>XIII.</h2>

<p>England himself chose a crew to row<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
me across the beach, and I have no doubt
selected the least reprehensible of all the
gang; for although they said little to me,
they showed no disposition either to be insolent
or to offer violence to me; one of
them even took off his jacket and laid it in
the stern-sheets for me to sit upon. And
truly, in spite of their wicked ways, there is
not so much difference betwixt some of
these fellows and the common sailors in our
merchant service, excepting that the poor
wretches have been led astray by evil counsel
until they have broken the laws and committed
outrages upon the high-seas, and so
are become outlawed and desperate. Moreover,
I believe there are many of them who
would return to better ways had they opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of so doing, and were not afraid of
suffering for the evil things which they
have committed.</p>

<p>But at that time I thought little or nothing
of how they regarded me, my only desire
being to get ashore, that I might hide
the precious despatch-box in some place of
safety. This I did as soon as might be after
I had landed, burying the casket in the
sand, and marking the place so that I might
know it again.</p>

<p>Some little distance beyond where I had
been put ashore from the pirate boat I
came upon a party of my own men under
Mr. White, who had been despatched after
me by Mr. Langely so soon as he had read
the communication which I had left behind
me at the king's town, and who had for
some time been lying hidden in the thickets,
whence they might observe the pirates
and still remain unseen by them.</p>

<p>I may confess that I was mightily glad
to behold such kind and friendly faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
again, nor did they seem less rejoiced than
myself at the meeting. They would not
allow me to walk, but making a litter of
two saplings, bore me by turns upon the
way, so that against the morning had come
we were safe in the king's town once more.</p>

<p>Mr. Longways was among the first to visit
me, and betrayed the most lively signs of
joy upon finding that I had been fortunate
enough to secure the great ruby once more,
though he regretted that I had not fetched
the box with me instead of having buried it
in the sand, so that we might have assured
ourselves of the safety of the treasure.
Upon this point I put him at his ease by
convincing him that the box was in such a
condition and of such an appearance as to
make me feel certain that it had neither
been forced nor the lock tampered with.</p>

<p>We only remained in the king's town
about three days longer; at the end of that
time the lookout which we had placed at
the cape came in and reported that the pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
crafts had hoisted sail and borne away
to the southward, leaving behind them the
battered hulk of the smallest vessel, as they
had promised to do. This much many had
expected of them, but I doubt if any excepting
myself had ventured to hope that they
would fulfill the other part of the agreement
to which they had superscribed, viz., to leave
behind them the bales of goods which in
their half-drunken fit of generosity they
had promised. Yet there they were, neatly
stacked upon the beach, and even covered
with a tarpaulin. And I know not whether
it may be merely superstition upon their
part or no, but this much I have frequently
observed, that sailors of whatever condition
have such a vast regard and respect for any
paper or written document that they will
go to great extremity before they will do
aught to rupture or disobey the articles of
such a bond. So it was that I was not so
much surprised at this fulfillment as either
Mr. Langely or Mr. White.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
By this time I was sufficiently recovered
of my fever and of my wound to take upon
me the direction of affairs once more; accordingly,
in the space of two weeks, we
had so far patched up the battered hulk of
the pirate craft as to make her tolerably
sea-worthy, provided we encountered no
great stress of weather.</p>

<p>It took us about a week longer to victual
and water the vessel (the bales of goods
which I had begged from the pirates having
been already stowed away under cover),
so that it was not until the 18th of August
that we were able to leave the country&mdash;which
we did, giving thanks for all the mercies
that had been vouchsafed to us in this
trying and terrible time.</p>

<p>We were becalmed off the coast of Arabia,
where we suffered greatly from the
scarcity of water; but being brought safely
through that and other dangers, we arrived
at last at Bombay, where we dropped anchor
early in the afternoon of the 13th of October,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
it being nigh upon two months since we
had left the coast of Juanna.</p>

<p>I immediately sent a message to the Governor,
Mr. Boon, notifying him of the safe
arrival of Mistress Pamela, and that I was
now ready to deliver the despatch-box at
such time as he should choose to appoint.
I also forwarded to him by the messenger a
full report of all that had happened, and of
the loss of the <i>Cassandra</i> in the engagement
on the 23d of July.</p>

<p>In about an hour and a half Mr. Boon
came aboard. He spoke most kindly and
flatteringly of the service which he was
pleased to say I had rendered the Company.
He urged me to accompany him to the
shore, but though I was mightily inclined
to accept of his kindness, I was forced to
decline at that time; for, finding that the
Company's ship, the <i>City of London</i>, was
about ready to sail, I had determined to
send by her a brief account of the things
herein narrated, and was at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
engaged in writing the letter which was
afterwards so widely published both in the
newspapers and in Captain Johnson's book
relating to the lives of the nine famous pirate
captains. Finding that I could not just
then quit the ship, he insisted that I should
sup with them that very night. I was only
too glad to accept of this, for I had determined
that I would discover in what manner
of regard Mistress Pamela held me, and
that without loss of time. I had now every
right to offer my addresses to her, which I
had not had heretofore. Accordingly, having
delivered the despatch-box into Mr.
Boon's hands with feelings of the most sincere
and heart-felt relief, and having obtained
his receipt for the same, I escorted Mistress
Pamela to the Governor's boat, thence
returning to my own cabin feeling strangely
lonely and melancholic.</p>

<p>This was about half-past two o'clock in
the afternoon; at about four a small boat
came alongside, and a young man of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
twenty-three years of age stepped upon the
deck, who introduced himself as Mr. Whitcomb,
the Governor's secretary. He brought
a written message from the Governor requesting
my immediate presence at the
Residency upon a matter of the very first
importance. I turned to Mr. Whitcomb and
asked if he knew what was the nature of the
business the Governor would have with me.</p>

<p>He said no, but that the Governor and
Mr. Elliott, the Company's agent, had been
closeted together with Mr. McFarland and
Mr. Hansel, of the banking-house, for some
time, and then had sent this message to me
by him, which was plainly one of very great
consequence.</p>

<p>I immediately entered the boat with the
secretary, and was rowed to the shore, where,
when we had come to the Residency, I found
the four gentlemen waiting for me. They
were seated around a table, whereon was the
despatch-box and my written report, which
consumed some six or eight sheets of paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
The Governor invited me to be seated,
which I had hardly done when one of the
company, whom I afterwards found to be
Mr. Elliott, began questioning me. I answered
fully to everything he asked, the
others listening, and now and then putting
in a word, or asking for fuller particulars
upon some point or other which was perhaps
more obscure. When I came to the
part that related to Captain Leach I saw
them glance at one another in a very peculiar
way; but I continued without stopping
until I had told everything concerning
the matter from the beginning to the end.
No one said anything for a little time, until
at last Mr. Elliott spoke:</p>

<p>"Do I correctly understand from this report,"
says he, touching the papers which
lay upon the table as he spoke, "that Mr.
Longways betrayed the nature of the contents
of the despatch-box both to you and
to Captain Leach?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I.</p>

<p>"And you are sure that no one knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of the presence of the jewel but you and
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, again.</p>

<p>At this the gentlemen exchanged glances,
and Mr. Elliott continued his questioning.</p>

<p>"And did you not know that Captain
Leach had been left behind when you quitted
the <i>Cassandra</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," said I. "It was intended
that he should go in the first passage of the
long-boat with the boatswain."</p>

<p>"But did you not say that you helped the
women aboard of the long-boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I did," I said.</p>

<p>There was a pause of a moment or two,
and all sat regarding me. Presently Mr.
Elliott spoke again.</p>

<p>"And did you not then see that Captain
Leach was absent from the boat?" said
he.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said I, "I did not; the boat
was very full, and the air so thick with gunpowder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
smoke that I could see little or
nothing at any distance."</p>

<p>"But did you not then take care to see
that all your passengers were safe aboard?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," said I. "The order had
been passed for all passengers to go aboard
the long-boat, and I supposed that Captain
Leach had obeyed with the rest. I was so
occupied with the safety of the women just
then that I thought of nothing else."</p>

<p>"You say that the pirate England told
you that Captain Leach had been killed
when they first came aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>.
Did you take any other evidence in the
matter than his word?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," said I, "I did not."</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott said "Humph!" and another
short space of silence followed, during which
he played absently with the leaves of my
report.</p>

<p>"But tell me, Captain Mackra," said he,
presently, "did you not speak to any one of
your suspicions concerning Captain Leach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
after he had quitted the ship on the night
of the 21st in such a mysterious manner?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," said I; "for I saw no sufficient
grounds to accuse him of any underhand
practices."</p>

<p>"And yet," said a thin, middle-aged gentleman,
with a sharp voice, whom I afterwards
found to be Mr. McFarland&mdash;"and
yet you saw him quit the <i>Cassandra</i> in a
most suspicious manner, and under the most
suspicious circumstances, and also had reason
to suspect him of having knowledge of
the jewel. Why, then, did you not examine
him publicly or put him under arrest after
he returned?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "I disliked Captain Leach,
and feared that my prejudice might lead me
astray."</p>

<p>"But, Captain Mackra," said the Governor,
"your personal feelings should never interfere
with your duty."</p>

<p>I knew not where all these matters tended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
but I began to be mightily troubled in
my mind concerning them. However, I had
little time for thought, for Mr. Elliott began
questioning me again. He asked me if I
had told any one of my intended visit to the
pirate-ship, of whom I had seen there, and
of what inducements I had offered to persuade
them to give me one of their crafts
and return such a quantity of the Company's
goods. He cross-questioned me so
keenly in regard to the last point that I
found myself tripping more than once, for
it is mightily difficult to remember all of
the petty details even of such an important
event as that. I believe that I answered
more loosely than I otherwise would have
done from the agitation into which I was
cast by the serious shape which matters
seemed to be taking.</p>

<p>"Sir," I cried to Mr. Elliott, "do you
blame me for getting back so much of the
Company's goods as I was able?"</p>

<p>"I blame you for nothing, Captain Mackra,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
said he. "I merely question you in
regard to a matter of great importance."</p>

<p>"But, sir," I said, hotly, "am I to be
blamed for losing my ship after a hard-fought
battle? You should recollect, sir,
that I was wounded in the Company's service;
methinks, sir, that should weigh some
in my favor."</p>

<p>"But, Captain Mackra," said Mr. McFarland,
very seriously, "are not accidents
likely to happen to any one under any
circumstances? Captain Leach, you may
remember, was killed in spite of all the precautions
he may have taken to preserve his
life."</p>

<p>A great weight of dread seemed to have
been settling upon me as the examination
had progressed, but at these words it was
as though a sudden light flashed upon me;
I rose slowly from my chair, and stood with
my hand leaning upon the table. For a
moment or two my head swam with vertigo,
and I passed my hand across my forehead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
"I am not so well, gentlemen," said I, "as I
was some time since, for I have gone through
many hardships; therefore I beseech you
to excuse me if I have appeared weak in
the manner or the matter of my discourse."
Then turning to the Governor, "Will you
be pleased to tell me, sir, what all this
means?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, in a low tone, "the ruby
has been stolen, and was not in the box
when you gave it to me."</p>

<p>I stood looking around at them for a
while; I know that I must have been very
pale, for Mr. McFarland sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Captain Mackra, you are ill," he said;
"will you not be seated?"</p>

<p>I shook my head impatiently, and collecting
myself, I said, very slowly and somewhat
unsteadily, "Do you suspect me of being instrumental
in taking it?"</p>

</div>

<p>No one answered for an instant. Then
the Governor said, "No, Captain Mackra,
we suspect you of nothing; only it is best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
that you should return to England and
make your report to the Company in person.
Meanwhile you will make no effort
to leave this country until I find means to
secure your passage for you."</p>

<p>"I am to consider myself under arrest?"
said I.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the Governor, kindly, "not
under arrest; but you must hold yourself
prepared to stand your examination before
the proper agents of the Company at London,
and at such time as they may decide
upon."</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>

<p>So soon as I had left the Residency I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
went straight aboard my craft. I entered
my cabin, locked the door, and began pacing
up and down, striving to collect my
thoughts and to shape them into some sort
of order. At first I was possessed with a
most ungovernable fury&mdash;that I, who had
suffered so much, who had fought till I
could fight no more, and who had freely
risked my life in the Company's cause,
should now be accused of stealing that very
thing that had cost me such suffering and
so great a weight of trouble. But by-and-by
the ferment of my spirits began somewhat
to subside, and I could look matters
more coolly in the face. Then, instead of
anger, I became consumed with anxiety, for
I began, little by little, to perceive what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
dreadful cloud of suspicion overshadowed
me. I had acted to the best of my light
in not accusing Captain Leach of what I
feared might be unfounded suspicions bred
of my dislike of his person. Now all men
would think that I was leagued with him in
robbing the Company of the great ruby. In
return for my forbearance in not making a
public accusation against him, he had betrayed
me and all that were aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>,
and now every one would believe
that I had aided him in that as in the rest.
He had remained behind in the hopes of
joining the pirates, and so securing himself
in the possession of his booty. Instead of
accomplishing this, he had perished miserably
on board of that craft, wet with the
blood of those whom he had betrayed; but
as for me, how could I ever disprove the
horrid charge that I had deserted my confederate
in guilt, leaving him to his death,
so that I might gain all for myself. The
very fact of my taking my life into my hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and going so freely among those wicked
and bloody wretches, instead of weighing in
my favor, would seem to point to some sort
of bargain with them whereby I was the
gainer; for who would believe that they
would voluntarily have resigned so great a
part of those things which they had a short
time before torn away from us at the cost
of so much blood? Even the fact of my
having so carefully guarded the secret of
the stone might be twisted into sinister suspicions
against me.</p>

<p>As for those bright hopes that I had but
lately entertained, how could I now raise
my eyes towards Mistress Pamela, or how
could I look for anything, who was stained
with such dreadful suspicions, without prospect
of being cleansed from them?</p>

<p>Perceiving all these things so clearly, I
resigned myself to the depths of gloomy
despair, for the more I bent my mind upon
these matters the less did I see my way
clear from my entanglements. I sat long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
into the night, thinking and thinking, until
the temptation came upon me to shoot out
my brains, and be quit of all my troubles in
that sudden manner. In this extremity I
flung myself upon my knees and prayed
most fervently, and after a while was more
at peace, though with no clearer knowledge
as to how I might better my condition. So
I went to my berth, where I was presently
sound asleep, with all my troubles forgot.</p>

<p>A day or two after these things had befallen
comes one of the Company's clerks
aboard, with an order from Mr. Elliott relieving
me of my command, and appointing
Mr. Langely in my stead. This appointment
Mr. Langely would have refused had
I not urged him to accept of it, seeing he
could better settle the affairs of which he
would be in charge than one who would
come aboard a stranger. Accordingly he
consented to do as I advised, though protesting
against it most earnestly.</p>

<p>About two weeks after our arrival at Bombay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the Governor notified me that the Company's
ship <i>Lavinia</i> was about quitting her
anchorage, and that he had secured a berth
to England in her for me. I was very well
pleased that the Governor had hit upon this
one ship of all others in the Company's
service, for her commander, Captain Croker,
was an old and well-tried friend of mine,
and one with whom it would be more pleasing
to be consociated at a time of such extreme
ill fortune as I was then suffering
under. I went aboard her at once, and was
most kindly received by Captain Croker,
whom I found had had a very comfortable
berth fitted up for me, and had arranged all
things to make my voyage as pleasant as
possible.</p>

<p>The day after I came aboard, wind and
tide being fair, and Captain Croker having
received his orders, we hoisted anchor and
sailed out of the harbor, and by four o'clock
had dropped the land astern.</p>

<p>During the first part of that voyage, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
I had contrived to leave the <i>Lavinia</i>, of
which I shall hereafter tell, my mind was
constantly and continually filled with my
troubles, so that they were the first thing
which I remembered in the morning, and
the last thing which I forgot before I fell
asleep. But that which puzzled me more
than anything else was to account for the
mysterious manner in which the Rose of
Paradise had been spirited away from the
iron despatch-box, and what had become of
it after it had passed from Mr. White's possession.
Of this I thought and pondered
until my brain grew weary.</p>

<p>One night, we being at that time becalmed
off the Gulf of Arabia, I sat upon the
poop-deck looking out over the water and
into the sky, dusted all over with an infinite
quantity of stars, and with my mind still
moving upon the same old track which it
had so often travelled before. I know not
whether it was the refreshing silence which
reigned all about me, but of a sudden it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
seemed as though the uncertainties which
had beset my mind were removed, and the
whole matter stood before me with a most
marvellous clearness. Then I knew, as
plain as though it had been revealed to me,
that the only man in the world who either
had the Rose of Paradise in his possession,
or knew where it was hidden, was Captain
Edward England.</p>

<p>I do not think that I came to this conclusion
through any line of reasoning, but
rather with a sudden leap of thought; but
as soon as I had fairly grasped it I marvelled
at the dulness of my understanding,
which should have prevented my perceiving
it before; for every single circumstance
that had happened pointed but in one direction,
and that was towards the end which
I had but just reached.</p>

<p>It was as plain as the light of day that
when Captain Leach went aboard of the
pirate craft on the night of the 21st of July,
Captain England would require him to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
his object in betraying the <i>Cassandra</i>
into their hands; and it was equally plain
that Leach would have to tell the truth; for
it was not likely that he could deceive such
a sharp and cunning blade as that famous
freebooter. I recalled the strange look
which Captain England had given me when
he told me that Captain Leach had been
"shot by accident" upon their coming
aboard the <i>Cassandra</i>; whereupon, regarding
matters from my present stand-point, I
felt assured that England had killed Leach
with his own hand, so that with him the secret
of the stone might perish from amongst
them. I also felt convinced that he must,
with great care and circumspection, have
picked the lock of the despatch-box and
have despoiled it of its contents, which he
had kept for himself without informing any
of his shipmates of what he had found.</p>

<p>I could not at first account for the treatment
that I had met with at the pirates'
hands, nor why I had not been shot so soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
as I had stepped upon their decks, for it was
plain to see that that would be the easiest
and quickest way for Captain England to
rid himself of me; yet it was very apparent
to me that he desired that my life should
be saved, and was even inclined to show me
some kindness after his own fashion; and I
do verily believe that that wicked and bloody
man entertained a sincere regard for my
person, and had it in his mind to do me a
good turn; for even the very worst of men
have some seed of kindness in them, otherwise
they could not be of our human brotherhood,
but wild beasts, thinking only of
rending and tearing one another.</p>

<p>But I could easily perceive that so soon
as England felt assured of my coming
aboard of his craft, he would strive to mislead
me into thinking that he knew nothing
of the stone, lest by some inadvertent word
I should betray a knowledge of it to the
others, and he would have to share his spoil
with them. Therefore he would carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
lock the box again, and would toss it in the
corner to lead me to think he knew nothing
of the contents.</p>

<p>All this train of reasoning I followed out
in my mind, and when I recalled the quizzical,
cunning look which the rogue had
given me when I asked for the despatch-box,
I felt certainly assured that I was right.</p>

<p>I remember that when I had clearly cogitated
all this out in my own mind I felt as
though one step had been gained towards
the recovery of the stone, and for an instant
it seemed as though a great part of the
weight of despondency had been lifted from
my breast. But the next moment it settled
upon me again when I brought to mind that
I was as far as ever from regaining the jewel;
for I knew not where the pirates then
were, and even if I did know, and was venturesome
enough to face their captain a second
time, it was not likely that he would be
so complacent as to give back such a great
treasure for the mere asking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Nor do I think it likely that I would ever
have gained anything by this knowledge
which had come to me (unless I might have
used it to help my case with the East India
Company) had not Providence seen fit to
send me help in a most strange and unexpected
manner. And thus it was:</p>

<p>One morning when I came upon deck I
saw several of the passengers, together with
the captain and the first mate, standing at
the lee side of the ship and looking out forward,
Captain Croker with a glass to his eye.
Upon inquiring they told me that the lookout
had some little time before sighted a
small open boat, which had been signalling
the ship with what they were now able to
make out was a shirt tied to the blade of an
oar. We ran down to the boat, which we
reached in twenty or thirty minutes, and
then hove to, and it came alongside.</p>

<p>There were three men in her, who seemed
to be in a mightily good condition for castaways
in an open boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
I stood looking down into it along with
other of the passengers, watching the men
as they took in their oars and laid them
along the thwarts. Just then one of the
fellows raised his face and looked up; and
when I saw him I could not forbear a sudden
exclamation of amazement. I remember
one of my fellow-passengers, a Mr. Wilson,
who stood next to me, asked me what
was the matter. I made some excuse or
other that was of little consequence, but
the truth was that I recognized the fellow
as that very pirate who had first kicked me
in the loins when I lay bound upon the
deck of the <i>Cassandra</i>, and whom Captain
England had knocked down with the iron
belaying-pin.</p>

<p>However, the fellow did not recognize me,
for I was a very different object now than
when he had seen me lying upon the pirate
deck, pinched with my sickness, barefoot
and half naked, and my cheeks and chin
covered over with a week's growth of beard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The three fellows presently came aboard,
and were brought aft to the quarter-deck,
where Captain Croker stood, just below the
rail of the deck above. They told a very
straightforward story, and I could not help
admiring at their coolness and the clever
way in which they passed it off. They said
that they had been part of the crew of the
brigantine <i>Ormond</i>, which had been lost
in a storm about a hundred and twenty
leagues north of the island of Madagascar.
That the captain and six of the crew had
taken the long-boat, and that they had
become separated from her in the darkness
two nights before. They answered all
of Captain Croker's questions in a very
straightforward manner, and with all the
appearance of truth. After satisfying himself,
he told them that they might go below
and get something to eat, and that he would
carry them to England as a part of the
ship's crew.</p>

<span class="caption">THE THREE FELLOWS WERE BROUGHT AFT TO THE QUARTER-DECK,
                      WHERE CAPTAIN CROKER STOOD, JUST BELOW THE RAIL OF THE DECK ABOVE.</span>
</div>

<p>At first I was inclined to tell the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
truth concerning them to Captain Croker,
but on second thoughts I determined to see
what the fellows had to say for themselves;
for I only recognized one of them, and, after
all, their story might be true, and that one
have given up his wicked trade in the four
or five months since I had last seen him.</p>

<p>About an hour after this I saw my friend
the pirate engaged forward in coiling a rope.
I came to him and watched him for a while,
but he kept steadily on with what he was
about, and said nothing to me.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, after a bit, "and how
was Captain England when you saw him
last?"</p>

<p>The fellow started up as suddenly as
though the rope had changed to an adder
in his hands. He looked about him as
though to see if any one were near and had
overheard what I said to him, and then recovered
himself with amazing quickness.
He grinned in a simple manner, and chucked
his thumb up to his forelock. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
was it you were saying, sir?" says he. "I
didn't just understand you."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said I; "that will never
pass amongst old friends. Why, don't you
remember me?"</p>

<p>He looked at me in a mightily puzzled
fashion for a while. "No, sir; asking your
pardon, sir," said he, "I don't remember
you."</p>

<p>"What!" said I, "have you forgot Captain
Mackra, and how you gave him a kick in
the side when he lay on the deck of the
<i>Cassandra</i>, down off Juanna?" As the fellow
looked at me I saw him change from
red to yellow and from yellow to blue; his
jaw dropped, and his eyes started as though
a spirit from the dead had risen up from the
decks in front of him. "So," said I, "I see
you remember me now."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, sir," said he, "don't ruin
a poor devil who wants to make himself
straight with the world. I was drunk when
I kicked you, sir&mdash;the Lord knows I was;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
you wouldn't hang me for that, sir, would
you?"</p>

<p>"That depends," said I, sternly, "upon
whether you answer my questions without
telling me a lie, as you did Captain Croker
just now."</p>

<p>"I wish I may die, sir," said he, "if what
I tell you ain't so. We all three of us left
the <i>Royal James</i> last night&mdash;she was the
<i>Cassandra</i>, sir, but we christened her a new
name, and hoisted the Black Roger over
her. We got scared, sir, at the way things
was going since Ned England left us and
Tom Burke turned captain; for he ain't the
man England was, and that's the truth. All
we ask now, sir, is to start fair and square
again; and so be if we don't hang for this,
I wish I may be struck dead, sir, if I, for
one, go back to the bloody trade again. So
all I want is to have a fair trial, and I begs
of you, sir, that you won't say the word that
would hang us all up to the yard-arms as
quick as a wink."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I am mightily afraid that I did not hear
the last of the fellow's discourse, for one
part of the speech that he had dropped
went through me like a shot. "How is
that?" I cried. "Was not Captain England
with you when you deserted the ship?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir," says he. "You see, sir,
when we sailed away from Juanna, Tom
Burke began to move heaven and earth
against England, and back of him he had
all of the worst of the crew aboard. First
of all he began setting matters by the
ears because England and Ward had been
wheedled into giving you&mdash;asking your
pardon, sir&mdash;a good sound vessel and all
them bales of cloth stuff. I tell you plain,
sir, Burke would never have let you had
'em if he hadn't wanted to use the matter
against England. Well, sir, one night Ward
fell overboard&mdash;nobody knowed how&mdash;and
there was an end of him. After that they
weren't long in getting rid of England, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I cried, impatiently, "but how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
did you get rid of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," says he, "they marooned him
on a little island off the Mauritius, and six
others with him; they was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind them," I cried; "but tell
me, do you know what became of him?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir," says he; "leastways we
knew of him by hearsay; and this was how:
About eight weeks ago we ran into a cove
on the south shore of Mauritius to clean
both ships, which had grown mightily foul.
While we lay there on the careen a parcel
of the crew who had been off hunting for
game fetched back one of the self-same fellows
we had marooned two months and
more before. He told us that England and
his shipmates had made a little craft out of
bits of boards and barrel-staves, and had
crossed over to the Mauritius in a spell of
fair weather, though it was five leagues and
more away."</p>

<p>To all this I listened with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
intentness. "And is that all you know of
him?" said I. "And can you not tell whether
he is yet on the island?"</p>

<p>The fellow looked at me for a moment
out of the corners of his eyes without
speaking. "Look 'ee, sir," said he, after a
little while, "what I wants to know is this:
be ye seeking to harm Ned England or
not?"</p>

<p>"And do you trouble yourself about
that?" says I. "Sure he can be no friend
of yours, for did I not myself see him knock
out a parcel of your teeth with an iron belaying-pin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," says he; "but I bear him
no grudge for that."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "then neither do I bear
him a grudge, and I give you my word of
honor that I mean no harm to him."</p>

<p>The fellow looked at me earnestly for a
while. "You wants to know where Ned
England is, don't you, sir?" said he.</p>

<p>I nodded my head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
"And I wants to be perserved from hanging,
don't I?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head again.</p>

<p>"Then look 'ee, sir," says he, "we'll strike
a bit of a bargain: if you'll promise to say
nothing to harm me and my shipmates, I'll
tell you where to find Ned England."</p>

<p>I considered the matter for a while. The
fellow had told me a straightforward story,
nor did I doubt that he intended to break
away from his evil courses. I may truly say
that I verily believe I would not have betrayed
the three poor wretches under any
circumstances. "Very well," said I, "I promise
to keep my part of the bargain."</p>

<p>"Upon your honor?" said he.</p>

<p>"Upon my honor," said I.</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said he, "you will find him
at Port Louis, in the Mauritius," and he
turned upon his heel and walked away.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>XV.</h2>

<p>I was filled with the greatest exultation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
by the knowledge which I had gained
through the deserter from the pirates, for
not only had I discovered the whereabouts
of the one man in all of the world whom I
felt well convinced had knowledge of the
Rose of Paradise, but that man no longer
had a crew of wicked and bloody wretches
back of him, but stood, like me, upon his
own footing. Therefore I determined that
I would by some means or other either regain
the treasure or perish in the attempt,
for I would rather die than live a life of dishonor
such as now seemed to lie before me.
However, I plainly perceived that if I would
recover the treasure I would have to escape
from the ship by some means or other whilst
we were upon our passage and near the isle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of Mauritius, for if I lost time by going
home and standing my examination, many
things might occur which would lose the
chance to me forever: England might quit
the Mauritius, or gather together another
crew of pirates upon his own account, for
with such a treasure as the Rose of Paradise
he had it clearly in his power to do
that and much more.</p>

<p>At that time our English vessels were
used to lay their course up and down the
Mozambique Channel, and not along the
eastern coast of Madagascar; for the Mauritius
and other islands which lie to the
north-east of that land belong to the French
or Dutch, as those in the Channel belong
to us. Therefore it was necessary to my
purpose that I should persuade Captain
Croker to alter his course, so as to run
down outside the island instead of through
the Channel, for it was plain to see that even
if I should be able to escape from the <i>Lavinia</i>
to Juanna or to any of the coadjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
islands, I would be as far as ever from getting
to Mauritius, which lieth many leagues
away around the northern end of Madagascar.</p>

<p>So I determined to make a clean breast
of it, and confide the whole plan to Captain
Croker from beginning to end, only I would
say nothing as to how I had gained my
knowledge of England's whereabouts, for I
would not break the promise which I had
given to the deserter, as told above.</p>

<p>As no time was to be lost in following
out the plans which I had determined upon,
I requested that I might have speech with
Captain Croker that very night. I told him
everything concerning the affair from beginning
to end, adding nothing and omitting
nothing. Although so old and so well-tried
a friend, he was cast into the utmost
depths of wonder and amazement at my audacity
in proposing that he should alter the
course of his vessel, and at my boldness in
daring to tell him my plans for escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
from the restraint under which I had been
placed. He questioned me closely concerning
many matters: as to what led me to
think that England was the present possessor
of the jewel; as to how I proposed to
proceed after I had escaped to the land; and
as to how I had become informed of the
pirate's whereabouts, concerning which last
particular I would give him no satisfaction.</p>

<p>I knew not what he had in his mind, nor
where all these questions tended, and by-and-by
left the cabin, though in a sad state
of uncertainty, not knowing how Captain
Croker inclined, nor what might be his feelings
in regard to me.</p>

<p>Nor was my uncertainty lessened for several
days, in which time I knew not what to
think, but waited for some sign from him.
One evening, however, the whole matter
was resolved in a most simple, natural, and
unexpected manner.</p>

<p>At that time we were about seventy or
eighty leagues north of the island of Madagascar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
All the passengers being at supper,
with Captain Croker at the head of the
table, conversation began to run upon those
pirates who had much infested these waters
of late.</p>

<p>"Why," says Captain Croker, "the presence
of the rascals has so affected me that
I have determined to alter the course of my
vessel, and to run outside of Madagascar instead
of through the Mozambique Channel,
for it is well to have plenty of sea-room
either to fight or to run from these wicked
rogues. So now, if the wind holds good,
seeing we are such friends with the Frenchmen
in these peaceful days, I purpose stopping
at the Mauritius to take aboard fresh
provisions."</p>

<p>Captain Croker did not look at me whilst
he was saying all this, but studiously kept
his eyes upon the plate before him, and
presently rose and left the table.</p>

<p>As for me, I sat with my heart beating
within my breast as though it would burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
asunder, for I saw that my fate was decided
at last, and that one of the greatest happenings
in all of my life was soon to come upon
me.</p>

<p>In two days, as Captain Croker had predicted,
we dropped anchor in the harbor off
Port Louis at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
I ate but little supper that night,
my mind being so engrossed upon that
which I had undertaken to do.</p>

<p>We lay about half a mile from the shore,
the water in the bay being very calm and
still. I had procured four large calabash
gourds, with which I had made shift to rig
up a very decent float or life-preserver, for I
had need of some such aid in my expedition,
not being a very expert swimmer.</p>

<p>In all this time I had said nothing to Captain
Croker, nor he to me; but about seven
o'clock, it being at that time pretty dark, he
came to me where I stood by the rail of the
poop-deck.</p>

<p>"Jack," said he, in a low voice, "are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
still in the mind for carrying this thing
through?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," I said.</p>

<p>"To-night?" says he.</p>

<p>"To-night," says I.</p>

<p>"Then God bless you!" said he, and he
gave my hand a hearty grip. Then he
turned upon his heel and went below, and
I knew that my time for acting had arrived.</p>

<p>I had not much fear of sharks, for I had
seen enough of those cowardly creatures to
know that they rarely or never attack a
swimmer or a moving man, but only a body
floating upon the water as though dead;
moreover, at night they are asleep or in deep
water, for they are not often seen upon the
surface after the darkness has fairly fallen.</p>

<p>After the captain left me I looked around
and saw that no one else was nigh upon the
deck. I took my calabash gourds and entered
the boat that hung from the davits
astern. Taking a hint from Captain Leach,
I had secured a coil of line by which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
might lower myself into the water, for if I
had dropped with a splash I would have
been pretty sure to have been discovered.
Having removed my shoes and stockings,
which I wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin,
together with my tinder-box and flint and
steel, all of which I secured upon my head,
and having slipped the cords which bound
the calabashes under my arms, I slid down
the line into the water astern.</p>

<p>Having committed my life into the keeping
of Providence, I struck out boldly for the
shore, being aided by a current which set
towards it, and directing my course by the
lights which glimmered faintly in the distance.
So I reached the beach, and built a
fire, whereby I dried my clothes. Then, having
put on my shoes and stockings, which
had been kept pretty dry by the tarpaulin,
I walked up the beach in the direction of
the scattered row of houses which, the moon
having now risen, stood out very plain at
about a quarter of a mile distant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
I found the town to consist of a great
straggling collection of low one-story buildings,
mostly made of woven palm-branches,
smeared over with mud which had dried in
the sun. At this time it could not have
been much less than nine o'clock, and all
was dark and silent. I went aimlessly here
and there, not knowing whither to direct
my steps, until at last I caught sight of a
little twinkle of light, which I perceived
came through a crack of an ill-hung shutter.
I went around to the front of the hut, which
seemed larger and better made than others
I had seen. Above the door hung an ill-made
sign, and the moon shining full upon
it, I could plainly see a rude picture of a
heart with a crown above it, and underneath,
written in great sprawling letters,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Le C&oelig;ur du Roy</span>."</p>

<p>&mdash;From this I knew that it was an ordinary,
at which I was greatly rejoiced, and
also what suited me very well was to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
that it was French, for I had no mind to
fall in with English people just then, and
I knew enough of French to feel pretty
easy with the lingo. So into the place I
stepped, as bold as brass, and ordered a
glass of grog and something to eat.</p>

<p>There were perhaps half a score of rough,
ill-looking fellows gathered around a dirty
table playing at cards by the light from a
flame of a bit of rope's-end stuck in a calabash
of grease. They laid down their cards
when I came in, and stared at me in a very
forbidding fashion. However, I paid no attention
to them, but sat down at a table at
some little distance, and by-and-by the landlord,
a little pot-bellied, red-faced Frenchman,
brought me a glass of hot rum and a
dish of greasy stew seasoned with garlic.
He would have entered into talk with me,
but I soon gave him to understand that I
had no appetite for conversation just at this
time; so after having made a bargain for
lodgings during the night, he withdrew to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
a bench in the farther corner of the room,
where I presently saw him fall asleep.</p>

<p>If I had hoped to escape from meeting
my own countrymen, I soon discovered that
I was to be sadly disappointed, for before I
had been in the place a quarter of an hour
I found that at least half the fellows around
the table were Englishmen. They were the
most villanous, evil-looking set of men that
I had beheld in a long time, and I could not
but feel uneasy, for I had with me gold and
silver money to the value of between ten
and eleven guineas, and by their muttering
together and looking in my direction now
and then I knew that they were talking concerning
me.</p>

<p>Presently one of the fellows got up from
the table and came over to the place where
I sat.</p>

<p>"Look 'ee, messmate," said he, seating
himself upon the corner of the table beside
me; "be ye English, French, Dutch, Portuguese,
or what?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
At first I was of a mind to deny being an
Englishman, but on second thoughts I perceived
that it would be useless to do so,
there being the scum of so many peoples at
that place that I could not hope to escape
exposure.</p>

<p>"Why, shipmate," said I, "I'm an Englishman."</p>

<p>"Where do ye hail from?" said he.</p>

<p>"Over yonder," said I, pointing in the direction
of the <i>Lavinia</i>.</p>

<p>"Did ye come aboard of the craft that
ran into the harbor to-day?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head.</p>

<p>"Did ye come ashore without leave?"</p>

<p>I nodded my head again.</p>

<p>The others had all laid down their cards
and were looking at us by this time, and I
knew not what would have been the upshot
of the matter had not the door just then
been flung open and a great rough fellow
come stumping into the place.</p>

<p>"Well," he bawled, in a loud, hoarse voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
"poor Ned is on his way to h&mdash;l hot-foot
to-night. I just came by his stew-hole over
yonder. Pah!"&mdash;here the fellow spat upon
the floor&mdash;"he was screeching and howling
and yelling as though the d&mdash;l was basting
him already."</p>

<p>"Who's with him now?" says one of the
fellows at the table.</p>

<p>"Who's with him?" says the other, in a
mightily contemptuous tone. "Why, d'ye
think that anybody would be such a &mdash; &mdash; fool
as to stay with him now, with
nothing to be got for it but the black tongue
and a cursing?"</p>

<p>"But what I say is this," said an ill-looking
one-eyed fellow: "he's not the man to
serve his trade for all these here years and
nothing to show for it. It's all very well to
say that Jack Mackra shot the hoops off his
luck; but you mark my words, he's got a
cable out to windward somewhere, and he
ain't goin' to run on the lee shore with an
empty hold."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
I was so amazed to hear my own name
spoken that I knew not at first whether to
believe that which mine ears had heard or
whether they had heard aright. Then it
was as though a sudden light flashed upon
me. I needed not the next speech to tell
me everything.</p>

<p>"Well," says one of the fellows, "even if
so be as Ned England is going to smell
brimstone before this time to-morrow, I for
one see no reason to lose our game. Come
along, Blake," he sang out to the fellow who
had been speaking to me, and who rejoined
the others upon being bidden.</p>

<p>I was in a great ferment of spirits at all
this, for I perceived very clearly that England
was mightily sick, and perhaps dying,
with that dangerous fever known as the
"black tongue," from which it is a rare thing
for a man to recover with his life.</p>

<p>I observed that the fellow who had lately
come into the ordinary did not join in the
game along with the rest, but sat looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
on. By-and-by I contrived to catch his eye
as he glanced in my direction, whereupon I
beckoned to him, and he came over to the
table where I sat. Only a few words passed
between us, and those in a very low tone.</p>

<p>"Is Ned England all alone?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p>"Will you show me where he is?" said I.</p>

<p>He shot a quick look at me from under
his brows. "How much will you give?"</p>

<p>"A guinea" said I.</p>

<p>"I'll do it."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning."</p>

<p>That was all that passed, and then he
moved away and joined the others at the
table.</p>

<p>The next morning I purchased a good
large pistol from mine host, for I saw that
with such companions as I was like to fall
in with I would need some sort of weapon
to protect myself. Having loaded it with a
brace of slugs, I thrust it in my belt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
then stepped out of the door, where I found
my acquaintance of the night before waiting
for me.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I am; but I must see
the color of your money before I go a single
step."</p>

<p>"It is yellow," said I, and held the guinea
out in the palm of my hand.</p>

<p>When he saw it his eyes shone like coals
and his fingers began to twitch. "Hand it
over," says he, "and I'll take ye straight."</p>

<p>"No, no," said I; "avast there, shipmate.
You get your money when I see Captain
Edward England, and not before."</p>

<p>"So be it," says he. "Lay your course
straight ahead yonder, and I'll follow after
and tell you how to go."</p>

<p>I looked coolly into the fellow's face, and
could not help grinning. "Why," says I,
"to tell the truth, shipmate" (here I drew
my pistol out of my belt and cocked it), "I
have no appetite for a knife betwixt the ribs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
so you'll just march ahead, and if you try
any of your tricks I'll put a brace of bullets
through your head as sure as you're alive."</p>

<p>The fellow looked at me for a while in a
puzzled sort of way; then he grinned, and
swinging on his heel strode away, I following
close behind him with the pistol ready
cocked in my hand. We went onward in
this way for about half a mile, until we came
to a little hut that stood by itself beyond
the rest of the town. My guide stopped
short about fifty paces away from the hut.
"There's where you'll find Ned England,"
said he, "and I'll go no farther for ten
guineas, for I've no notion of catching the
black tongue; and if you'll hearken to a
bit of advice, shipmate, you'll give it a wide
berth yourself."</p>

<p>I felt assured the fellow was telling me
the truth, so I paid him his guinea, and
then turned away and left him standing
where he was, and as I stopped in front
of the hut and looked back I saw that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
man was yet standing in the very same spot,
staring after me.</p>

<p>I may confess that I myself was somewhat
overcome with fear of the dreadful disease,
wherefore I stood for a moment before
I knocked upon the door. But I presently
rallied myself, calling to mind that this was
the only means of recovering the Rose of
Paradise, even if it was at the risk of my
own life; therefore I knocked loudly on the
door with the butt of my pistol.</p>

<p>My guide, who stood still in the same
place, called out to me that there was no
one to hear my knocking; so I pushed open
the door and entered the hut.</p>

<p>For a while I saw nothing, for it was very
dark within. But I heard a hoarse and
chattering voice, scarce above a whisper, crying
continually, "Hard a-lee!&mdash;hard a-lee!&mdash;hard
a-lee!"</p>

<p>Presently mine eyes became accustomed
to the gloom, and I might see the things
around more clearly. There, in the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
of the room, lying upon a mat of filthy rags,
his body almost a skeleton, his bloodshot
eyes glaring out from under his matted hair,
I beheld the famous pirate, Captain Edward
England.</p>

</div>

<hr class="major" />

<h2>XVI.</h2>

<p>I may truly say that when I saw the doleful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
state of the poor wretch, and how he lay
there without so much as a single soul to
moisten his lips or to give him a draught of
cold water, I forgot mine own troubles for
the time being, and thought only of his pitiable
condition.</p>

<p>I sometimes misdoubt whether I should
have felt grieved for such a wicked and
bloody man, who had for years done nothing
but commit the most dreadful crimes,
such as murther and piracy and the like,
yet seeing him thus prostrated, lying helpless,
and deserted by all his kind, I could
not help my bowels being stirred by compassion;
wherefore I thought neither of the
danger from his fever, nor of the many
grievous injuries which he had done, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
to myself and to others, but only of relieving
his present distresses.</p>

<p>My first consideration was to make him
more clean, wherefore I fetched some water
from a rivulet which I had noticed flow nigh
to that place, and washed his hands and face,
and so much of his body as seemed to me
fitting. Then I gathered some fresh palm-leaves,
and covered them over with a bit of
sail which I found rolled up in the back
part of the hut, and having thus made
thereof a clean and comfortable bed, I
carried the poor wretch thither and laid
him upon it.</p>

<p>As I had eaten nothing that morning, I
went back into the town and bought a lump
of meat and some fresh fruit, and then back
again to the hut. I noticed here and there
some that stood and looked after me, though
they said nothing to me, nor molested me
in any manner. I afterwards found that my
guide had so spread the news of my going
to England's hut that many knew it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
accredited me with being a friend of the
pirate's, and even a partaker in his wicked
and nefarious deeds. Whether it was from
this or from fear of contagion of the fever I
know not, but certain it is I was never once
molested so long as I was upon that island.</p>

<p>When I returned to the hut it seemed to
me that the sick man had less fever than
when I left him, which perhaps happened
from the refreshment of the washing that I
had given him, though it might have been
that the crisis of his distemper had arrived,
and that his complaint had now lessened in
its intensity.</p>

<p>Some time after mid-day I was sitting beside
the sick man, fanning both him and
myself, for though the nights were cool at
this season of the year, the middle of the
day was both exceeding hot and sultry. He
had ceased in his incessant and continuous
muttering and talking, and was now lying
quite silent, though breathing short and
quick with the fever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Suddenly he spoke. "Who are you?"
said he, in a quick, sharp voice.</p>

<p>I thought at first he was still rambling in
his mind, but when I looked at him I saw
that his bloodshot eyes were fixed upon me.
I placed my hand upon his brow, and
though still very hot, I fancied that the
skin was not so dry nor so hard as it had
been.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said he again in the
same tone.</p>

<p>"There," said I, "lie still and rest. You
have been mightily sick."</p>

<p>"Is it Jack Mackra?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," said I.</p>

<p>"And what do you do here?" said he.</p>

<p>"I am come to care for you just now,"
said I; "but now rest quietly, for I will not
answer one single question more, and that
I promise you."</p>

<p>He did not seek to speak again, but lay
quite still, as though meditating; and presently,
as I sat fanning him, I saw him close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
his eyes, and after a while, by his deep and
regular breathing, knew that he was asleep,
and that his fever had turned.</p>

<p>As I remember all the circumstances concerning
these things, I think that up to this
time I had given little if any thought concerning
the treasure of which I had been in
quest; but now, seeing the sick man fairly
asleep, and in what seemed to me a fair
way to mend, my mind went instantly back
to it again, for I felt well assured that I
should find it or some signs of it about the
place where I then was.</p>

<p>It is not needful to recount all the manner
in which I prosecuted my search for the
gem, for not only did I examine every scrap
of paper about the place in hopes of finding
some matter concerning it, but I sounded
the walls, and pierced wellnigh every inch
of the dirt floor with a sharpened stick of
wood, but found not one single sign of it
anywhere. I even searched in the pockets
of the breeches which the sick man wore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and of his coat and waistcoat, which hung
against the wall, but discovered nothing to
reward my search&mdash;all that I found there being
a book of needles and thread, a tailor's
thimble, a great piece of tobacco, such as
seafaring men always carry with them, a ball
of yarn about half the bigness of an orange,
and a hasp-knife.</p>

<p>I cannot tell the bitter disappointment
that took possession of me when my search
proved to be of so little avail; for I had felt
so sure of finding the jewel or some traces
of it, and had felt so sure of being able to
secure it again, that I could not bear to
give up my search, but continued it after
every hope had expired.</p>

<p>When I was at last compelled to acknowledge
to myself that I had failed, I fell
into a most unreasonable rage at the poor,
helpless, fever-stricken wretch, though I had
but just now been doing all that lay in my
power to aid him and to help him in his
trouble and his sickness. "Why should I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
not leave him to rot where he is?" I cried,
in my anger; "why should I continue to
succor one who has done so much to injure
me, and to rob me of all usefulness and
honor in this world?" I ran out of the
cabin, and up and down, as one distracted,
hardly knowing whither I went. But by-and-by
it was shown me what was right
with more clearness, and that I should not
desert the poor and helpless wretch in his
hour of need: wherefore I went back to the
hut and fell to work making a broth for him
against he should awake, for I saw that the
fever was broken, and that he was like to
get well.</p>

<p>I did not give over my search for the
stone in one day, nor two, nor three, but
continued it whenever the opportunity offered
and the pirate was asleep, but with as
little success as at first, though I hunted
everywhere. As for Captain England himself,
he began to mend from the very day
upon which I came, for he awoke from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
first sleep with his fever nigh gone, and all
the madness cleared away from his head;
but he never once, for a long while, spoke
of the strangeness of my caring for him in
his sickness, nor how I came to be there,
nor of my reasons for coming. Nevertheless,
from where he lay he followed me with
his eyes in all my motions whenever I was
moving about the hut.</p>

<p>One day, however, after I had been there
a little over a week, against which time he
was able to lie in a rude hammock, which I
had slung up in front of the door, he asked
me of a sudden if any of his cronies had
lent a hand at nursing him when he was
sick, and I told him no.</p>

<p>"And how came you to undertake it?"
says he.</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "I was here on business,
and found you lying nigh dead in this
place."</p>

<p>He looked at me for a little while in a
mightily strange way, and then suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
burst into a great loud laugh. After that
he lay still for a while, watching me, but
presently he spoke again.</p>

<p>"And did you find it?" says he.</p>

<p>"Find what?" I asked, after a bit, for I
was struck all aback by the question, and
could not at first find one word to say. But
he only burst out laughing again. "Why,"
says he, "you psalm-singing, Bible-reading,
straitlaced Puritan skippers are as keen as
a sail-needle; you'll come prying about in
a man's house looking for what you would
like to find, and all under pretence of doing
an act of humanity, but after all you find
an honest devil of a pirate is a match for
you."</p>

<p>I made no answer to this, but my heart
sank within me; for I perceived, what I
might have known before, that he had observed
the object of my coming thither.</p>

<p>He soon became strong enough to move
about the place a little, and from that time
I noticed a great change in him, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
he seemed to regard me in a very evil way.
One evening when I came into the hut, after
an absence in the town, I saw that he
had taken down one of his pistols from the
wall, and was loading it and picking the
flint. He kept that pistol by him for a
couple of days, and was forever fingering it,
cocking it, and then lowering the hammer
again.</p>

<p>I do not know why he did not shoot me
through the brains at this time; for I verily
believe that he had it upon his mind to do
so, and that more than once. And now, in
looking back upon the business, it appears
to me to be little less than a miracle that I
came forth from this adventure with my life.
Yet had I certainly known that death was
waiting upon me, I doubt that I should
have left that place; for in truth, now that I
had escaped from the <i>Lavinia</i>, as above narrated,
I had nowhere else to go, nor could I
ever show my face in England or amongst
my own people again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Thus matters stood until one morning
the whole business came to an end so suddenly
and so unexpectedly that for a long
while I felt as though all might be a dream,
from which I should soon awake.</p>

<p>We were sitting together silently, he in a
very moody and bitter humor. He had his
pistol lying across his knees, as he used to
do at that time.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to me as though in a
fit of rage. "Why do you stay about this
accursed fever hole?" cried he; "what do
you want here, with your saintly face and
your godly airs?"</p>

<p>"I stay here," said I, bitterly, "because I
have nowhere else to go."</p>

<p>"And what do you want?" said he.</p>

<p>"That you know," said I, "as well as I
myself."</p>

<p>"And do you think," said he, "that I will
give it to you?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, "that I do not."</p>

<p>"Look 'ee, Jack Mackra," said he, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
slowly, "you are the only man hereabouts
who knows anything of that red pebble"
(here he raised his pistol and aimed it directly
at my bosom); "why shouldn't I shoot
you down like a dog, and be done with you
forever? I've shot many a better man than
you for less than this."</p>

<p>I felt every nerve thrill as I beheld the
pistol set against my breast, and his cruel,
wicked eyes behind the barrel; but I steeled
myself to stand steadily and to face it.</p>

<p>"You may shoot if you choose, Edward
England," said I, "for I have nothing more
to live for. I have lost my honor and all
except my life through you, and you might
as well take that as the rest."</p>

<p>He withdrew the pistol, and sat regarding
me for a while with a most baleful look,
and for a time I do believe that my life
hung in the balance with the weight of a
feather to move it either way. Suddenly
he thrust his hand into his bosom and drew
forth the ball of yarn which I had observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
amongst other things in his pocket. He
flung it at me with all his might, with a
great cry as though of rage and of anguish.
"Take it," he roared, "and may the devil
go with you! And now away from here,
and be quick about it, or I will put a bullet
through your head even yet."</p>

<p>I knew as quick as lightning what it was
that was wrapped in the ball of yarn, and
leaping forward I snatched it up and ran as
fast as I was able away from that place. I
heard another roar, and at the same time
the shot of a pistol and the whiz of a bullet,
and my hat went spinning off before me as
though twitched from off my head. I did
not tarry to pick it up, but ran on without
stopping: but even yet, to this day, I cannot
tell whether Edward England missed
me through purpose or through the trembling
of weakness; for he was a dead-shot,
and I myself once saw him snap the stem
of a wineglass with a pistol bullet at an ordinary
in Jamaica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
As for me, the whole thing had happened
so quickly and so unexpectedly that I had
no time either for joy or exultation, but continued
to run on bareheaded as though bereft
of my wits; for I knew I held in my
hand not only the great ruby, but also my
honor and all that was dear to me in my
life.</p>

<p>But although England had so freely given
me the stone, I knew that I must remain in
that place no longer. I still had between
five and six guineas left of the money
which I had brought ashore with me when
I left the <i>Lavinia</i>. With this I hired a
French fisherman to transport me to Madagascar,
where I hoped to be able to work
my passage either to Europe or back to the
East Indies.</p>

<p>As fortune would have it, we fell in with
an English bark, the <i>Kensington</i>, bound for
Calcut, off the north coast of that land, and
I secured a berth aboard of her, shipping as
an ordinary seaman; for I had no mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
tell my name, and so be forced to disclose
the secret of the great treasure which I had
with me. After arriving at Calcut I was
fortunate enough to be able to find a vessel
ready to sail for Bombay, whereon I secured
a berth, and so arrived safe at that place
about the middle of March.</p>

<p>I had unrolled the ball of yarn and looked
at the stone so soon as I had been able to
do so after getting it into my possession.
Then, finding that it was safe and unhurt,
as I had seen it last, I had rolled it up again,
for I could perceive that there was no better
hiding-place for it than the one the cunning
pirate had provided. So for all this last
voyage I had carried a fortune of three
hundred and fifty thousand pounds in my
pocket, wrapped up in a ball of yarn.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>It was early in the morning when we arrived
at Bombay, and so soon as I was able
I disclosed my name and condition to the
captain under whom I had sailed, and contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
to impress him with the importance
of my commission, without disclosing anything
to him in regard to the stone. He
was very complacent to me, and would have
had me dress myself in a more fitting manner,
and in some of his own clothes, for I
was clad no better than the other seamen
with whom I had consociated for all this
time; but I was too impatient to delay my
going ashore for one moment longer than
was needful, so he kindly sent me off without
any further stay.</p>

<p>I went straight to the Residency, and
though the attendants would have stayed
me, I so insisted, both with words and with
force, that they were constrained to show
me directly into the presence of the Governor.</p>

<p>I found him seated with Mistress Pamela
at breakfast, beneath the shade of a wide
veranda overlooking a beautiful and luxuriant
garden. The Governor arose as I came
forward, looking very much surprised at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
boldness in so forcing my presence upon
his privacy. As for Mistress Pamela, I beheld
her eyes grow wide and her face as
white as marble, and thereby knew that she
had recognized me upon the instant.</p>

<p>I came direct to the table, and drawing
forth the jewel, still wrapped in the yarn
(for my agitation had been so great that I
had not thought to unroll the covering from
the stone), I laid it upon the table, with my
hands trembling as though with an ague.</p>

<p>"What does all this mean?" cried the
Governor. "Who are you, and what do
you want?" For I was mightily changed
in my appearance by the rough life through
which I had passed, and he did not recognize
me.</p>

<p>But I only pointed to the ball of yarn.
"Open it," I cried; "for God's sake, open
it!"</p>

<p>I saw a sudden light come into Mistress
Pamela's eyes. She clasped her hands, and
repeated after me, "Open it, open it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
The Governor himself seemed to be impressed
by our emotion; for, instead of troubling
himself to unwind the yarn, he snatched
up a bread-knife and cut through the
strands, so that they fell apart, and the jewel
rolled out upon the white linen table-cover.</p>

<p>The Governor gazed upon it as though
thunderstruck. Presently he slowly raised
his eyes and looked at me. "What is this?"
said he.</p>

<p>In the mean time I had somewhat recovered
from my excessive emotion. "Sir,"
said I, "it is the Rose of Paradise."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I am Captain John Mackra."</p>

<p>The Governor grasped my hand, and
shook it most warmly. "Sir," said he, "Captain
Mackra, I am vastly delighted to find
you such a man as my niece has always
maintained you to be. The little rebel has
led me a most disturbed and disquieted life
ever since I was constrained to order you
back to England under restraint. I now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
leave you a captive in her hands, trusting
to her to give you a famous dish of tea,
whilst I go and consign this great treasure
to some place of safe-keeping. I shall soon
return, for I am most impatient to hear your
narrative of those events which led to the
recovery of this stone."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned and left us, bearing
the Rose of Paradise with him, and I sat
down to a dish of tea with Mistress Pamela.</p>

<p>When the Governor returned he had first
to listen to other matters than those concerning
the Rose of Paradise; for, with his
consent, Pamela Boon had promised to be
my wife.</p>
